PREFACE
</p>

<p>
There is much truth in the old saying about the
difficulty of seeing the wood for the trees.  It is the
aim of this short book to keep the number of the
trees as few as possible so that the wood, as a whole,
may be clearly visible.
</p>

<p>
It is designed to provide scholars and their teachers
with an outline of the most important facts in the
history of mankind up to the date of the firm
establishment of the Roman Empire and the final destruction
of Jerusalem&mdash;a date at which the various threads
of the story come together to a point.  In order to
avoid confusing the learner, and to enable him to get
a clear view of the most important facts, all less
important facts and names and dates have been omitted.
</p>

<p>
With such an outline in his mind, the scholar,
coming to the study of a particular nation or period,
should be able to fit that nation or period into its
proper place.  In the absence of any such outline, he
must necessarily be at a loss to know the bearing of
this or that episode on the whole great story.

THE GREATEST STORY IN THE WORLD
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
BEFORE HISTORY WAS WRITTEN
</h3>

<p>
The greatest story in the world is the story of
mankind around the Mediterranean Sea.  The reason why
it is so great a story for us is that it is really our own
story.  It is the story of the doings of mankind from
the earliest date at which we know anything at all
about man; and it is the story of the doings which
have made you and me what we are to-day, and have
made our lives what they are.
</p>

<p>
You must first look at the world map to understand
the story properly.  Take out the atlas or the globe
of the world, and have a look at the Mediterranean
Sea as shown upon it.  You will see how very little
space this sea occupies in comparison with the whole.
And I want you to observe this very particularly,
because, as I hope to show you, small though this
space is, it is the space in, or closely around, which
nearly the whole story of man on the world, so far as
we know it, was made up to&mdash;what date shall we
say?&mdash;only a few hundred years ago&mdash;say the date of
Columbus' discovery of America.  If you know the
story of what happened in and about the Mediterranean
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P2"></a>2}</span>
Sea, you will know nearly all that anybody does know
of the really important things that men did in the
world up to the date of our Queen Elizabeth.
</p>

<p>
"But," you may say, "surely things were happening
in other places, as in China and in Peru, and in
Mexico, and all over the world, all the time?"
</p>

<p>
And so there were things happening, and things
which made a very great difference, no doubt, to the
people to whom they happened; but they were things
that made scarcely any difference at all, so far as we
are able to see, to the history of the world.  They
made great differences within the borders of the
countries in which they happened, but not beyond.
The happenings that went on round the shores of the
Mediterranean were the making of the world as we
know it to-day: I mean, of course, in so far as men's
actions have had anything to do with the making of it.
</p>

<p>
For the first part of the story we shall be occupied
with the eastern end only of the Mediterranean; and
I must ask you to carry your eye just a little&mdash;not
far&mdash;to the east again of the eastern shore of that sea.
That shore is called the Levant, from the Latin <i>levare</i>,
to rise, and it means the region in which the sun was
seen to rise by those who gave the name&mdash;that is to
say, the East.
</p>

<p>
A very short way, as it looks on the map of the
Western Hemisphere, to the east of that Levant shore,
you may see the two rivers Euphrates and Tigris,
rising very near together only a little south of the
Black Sea, yet not finding their way out into the sea
till they have gone a very long way south.  Then,
after coming together, they go out in each other's
company into the Persian Gulf.  A great part of that
space between the two rivers is called Mesopotamia,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P3"></a>3}</span>
and is the country where our armies had hard fighting
in the Great War.  Mesopotamia is from Greek μέσος,
meaning the middle, and πόταμος, a river, and means
the land in the middle of, or between, the two rivers.
Mediterranean, the name of the big sea, is from Latin
<i>medius</i>, meaning, again, the middle, and <i>terra</i>, the
earth; that is to say, the sea in the middle of the land.
It is almost entirely shut in by the land, its only way
out being by the narrow Straits of Gibraltar at the
western end.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The great rivers
</span>
</p>

<p>
So there you see those two rivers, Euphrates and
Tigris, running south and making the land in the
neighbourhood of their course very rich and fertile,
producing splendid crops and vegetation of all kinds.
And now, if you will carry your eye just a little to the
west and south of these, across Arabia and the Red
Sea, you will see another great river, only this time it
is a river running, not from the north to the south, but
from the south to the north.  It is the Nile, the river
of Egypt.  It goes out into the Mediterranean past a
city called Alexandria.  At its mouth it spreads out
into a number of channels, making an area intersected
by water channels.  This area has something
of the shape of the letter in the Greek alphabet which
corresponds to our "d" and is drawn thus Δ.  That
is roughly the shape of the space occupied by these
many mouths of the Nile, and the region is therefore
called the "Delta," which is the name of that letter of
the Greek alphabet.
</p>

<p>
I want you to take particular notice of these two
great river-courses, those of the Nile and of the
Euphrates with the Tigris.  I say Euphrates "with
Tigris," because the two are together the fertilisers
and waterers of the country lying between and around
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P4"></a>4}</span>
them.  The Nile does his business of watering his own
valley by himself.  It is most important that you
should give your attention to these two great
water-courses, because it is along them that arose the two
greatest empires, the two strongest and most formidable
powers, of which the early history of the world
has anything to tell us.
</p>

<p>
You may easily understand how this should be so.
Man, at first, from what we are able to learn about
him, knew very little of farming.  Such ideas as a
"rotation of crops," or of manuring the fields were
probably quite unknown to him for very many ages.
The first men whom we are able to learn anything
about seem to have depended on the hunting of other
animals for their living.  Then came a time when
they began to live on their flocks and herds.  Now,
both for the hunting and for the living by keeping
cattle and sheep, they had to be constantly on the
move.  They would kill out all the game in one
district and therefore have to move on to another.
Or their cows and sheep would eat up all the pasture
in one place and so they had to be moved to fresh
feeding-grounds.  These two first stages, which all
the scholars recognise, in man's story require that the
people who lived in them should be always moving, or
at least ready to move.  The stages are called the
Hunting Age and the Pastoral Age respectively.
The next age is called the Agricultural Age, when man
began to give "culture" to the "ager," or field.  He
was able to settle then.  It was not necessary for him
to be constantly on the move when he had begun to
live by the crops which he grew.  But he was not yet
a very clever or scientific farmer.  He could grow good
crops only when Nature helped him very freely, only
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
on the best soils, only in the river valleys or lands
watered by the rivers, and in a favourable climate.
</p>

<p>
The soil of Mesopotamia is still considered the most t
naturally rich in all the world: the Nile overflows its
banks every year, and the overflow leaves a wonderfully
rich mud behind it; the climate both in Mesopotamia
and in Egypt is very favourable to the growth of
vegetation.  Therefore, it is not to be wondered at
that when men began to lead a settled life they settled
themselves down along the courses of these two great
rivers&mdash;I write two, because I am regarding the
Euphrates and Tigris as one, for the moment&mdash;and
here formed themselves into communities and nations
so many in number and so prosperous that they became
stronger than any of their neighbours.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Earliest man
</span>
</p>

<p>
And now you are very likely to ask me, "What do
we know about the early history of man on the earth,
and how do we know it?"
</p>

<p>
The first thing that we know about man on the
earth is what we know by finding the weapons or tools
that show signs of his handiwork.  It is one of the most
distinguishing marks of man, setting him most clearly
apart from all other animals, that he has been a maker
of tools and weapons for an immense number of years.
Intelligent though some dogs and monkeys and other
animals are, not one of them has thought of doing this.
The oldest sort of tools or weapons that we find are
made of stone, generally of flint, chipped to a sharp
edge or point, so as to make axe or spear-head.  We
know them to be older than any of the metal tools or
weapons that we find, because we find them in a deeper
layer, or stratum, of the earth&mdash;a stratum deposited
before those which lie above it.  And we find them
in company with fossil remains of animals which are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
of less-developed species than those in the strata
above.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Man's tools and weapons
</span>
</p>

<p>
After a while&mdash;an immensely long while&mdash;there can
be little doubt that man discovered that the ore of
metals, which is found in the ground, can be fused, that
is to say, melted by fire; that it can be separated from
its earthy surroundings, and so be made useful.  Man
then began to make weapons and implements of metal,
and found them better than the weapons of stone.
We may infer this from the fact that the stone implements,
of sharp and shapen flint, become less numerous
as we come to higher strata, or layers, in the ground,
and the metal implements are more numerous.
</p>

<p>
The metal of which the earliest metal implements
were made is either pure copper or bronze, which is a
mixture of copper and tin.  Copper is not a very hard
metal.  I suppose that the more tin that was put into
the mixture, in comparison with the copper, the harder
it would be.  And then, after a while&mdash;again a very
very long while&mdash;man discovered another, a harder,
and therefore a better, kind of metal, that is to say
iron.  And he has never found a better metal in all
the long years of his story since.  Gold and platinum
may be more precious, because they are less common;
but iron is a great deal more useful to man.  His
weapons, his swords, bayonets, and cannons are made
of it; so are his ships; and you hardly can open
your eyes in a room without their resting on something
made of iron.  As soon as he had found out the
hardness of iron we may suppose that man quickly gave
up the use of the soft bronze, as he had formerly given
up the use of the stone in favour of the bronze.  Thus
it comes that you may read of the Stone Age, the Bronze
Age, and the Iron Age.  They refer to these three stages
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
in man's history: first, when he was using stone
implements, made of the chipped flint or the like hard
stone; second, when he was using the bronze weapons
and tools; and third, when he was using iron.
</p>

<p>
"But," you will say, "all this is hardly history.
It is not man's story.  We don't want to know so much
what kind of tools and weapons man had; we want
to know what he did with them.  You are not telling
us this."
</p>

<p>
It is quite true; I am not.  But the reason why
I have told you all this about man's tools, before
telling you what he did with them, is that I want you
to get clearly into your heads this truth&mdash;that even
the best and most learned of the men who have searched
back into history are able to tell us only a very small
part of the whole story of man's doings on the earth.
They have found out, perhaps, all that there is to find
about the records that man has intentionally left
of himself.  But the records begin rather far
on&mdash;at what we may call a late chapter&mdash;in the story.
They begin only about six or seven thousand years
ago.  And though that sounds a long time you must
understand that it really is quite short in comparison
with all the time that man has been living on the
earth.
</p>

<p>
It is very difficult for us, who have lived only a few
years, to form an idea in our minds of a great many
years.  I hardly know how best I may help you to
do so.  Suppose we take a thousand years as a length
for our consideration in the first place.  Consider this,
next, that there are, certainly, people alive now who
are a hundred years old, and perhaps a little older.
Imagine, if you can, the lives of ten such persons
who have lived one after the other.  Imagine that each
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
as a baby saw one of the others when that other was
a hundred years old.  Thus it would only take ten of
such happenings to cover the whole stretch of a
thousand years of which I want you to form some
idea.  The years of the lives of ten very long-lived
men would cover it.
</p>

<p>
It is quite possible that you may have seen a living
oak tree of much more than a thousand years old.
The people who have studied trees tell us that there
are oaks alive in England now which were alive in
the Saxon times; that is to say, some 1500 years
ago&mdash;one and a half thousand years.  I know that these
hints are not very effectual towards helping you to get
an idea of what a thousand years mean, but they are
the best that I can give you.  They seem to help me
to realise just a little what this great stretch of years
is.  We can do no better.
</p>

<p>
I wrote, a little while ago (<a href="#P7">p. 7</a>), "the records that
man has intentionally left of himself."  I put in that
word "intentionally" because, of course, the weapons
and tools and implements and ornaments that we find
were not left, by those who used them, with any
intention that they should give us any information
about their users.  They were just left, as a rule,
accidentally.  We can imagine something from them
about the kind of life that their users led, and
what kind of men they were that used them, but
they were not trying to give us any such information.

</p>

<p>
What we may call, I think, the intentional records
began when we find that man began to carve designs
on stone of what he had been doing, or to paint
pictures showing his doings, and, especially, when he
began to cut written words on the stone.  When we
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P9"></a>9}</span>
begin to get records of this kind, then we really do
begin to read the story&mdash;-we begin to know what man
was doing.  And the first records of the kind are of
date some five thousand years before the birth of
Christ; that is to say, some seven thousand years
ago.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The first records
</span>
</p>

<p>
And what do we find, from these carvings and pictures
and writings, that man was doing?  The records
that we are best able to read now are those which we
find in the more westerly of the two great river-courses
on which, as we have seen, man congregated.  It is
along the Nile, in Egypt, that we find the record most
clear.  I have little doubt that we might find it no
less clear along the other great river-courses, those of
the Euphrates and Tigris, also, were it not for this
difference&mdash;that Egypt and the Nile region was very
much better supplied with hard stone than the
Euphrates and Tigris region.  The result of that is
that the inscriptions and figures cut on the hard
Egyptian stone are legible still.  The other, more
eastern, records, cut on the brick which, in the absence
of stone, the builders made use of for nearly all
building purposes, have crumbled to pieces.  The wonder,
after so many years, is that anything at all should be
left, rather than that much has been lost.  The
Egyptian climate is very dry, except near the river's
mouth, at the Delta, and that dryness has helped to
preserve the records.
</p>

<p>
If we had the same records for the eastern as for
the western river-course, we should find, I expect,
that the way the people lived was very much alike in
both.  We may gather that it was a very pleasant
life, on the whole.  The climate was delightfully
warm; the soil gave them plentiful crops with very
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
little work for it.  Probably the eastern people were
the more pastoral, that is to say, kept more cattle and
sheep, but there were flocks and herds in the Nile
region also.  And in both there were wild beasts for
the hunting.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
EGYPT DOWN TO 1500 B.C.
</h3>

<p>
I told you that one of the ways by which man, at
different ages of the world, has been described is to
speak of him in the Hunting stage, the Pastoral, and
the Agricultural.  Although these people along the
great rivers probably settled down into the agricultural
stage earlier than others, still, that did not prevent
them from keeping cattle and hunting wild creatures.
The older the inscriptions and records, the more we
see of the hunting, so that we may imagine, as we
should expect, that the quieter business of farming
gradually came to occupy more of their lives as time
went on, and that the hunting occupied them less.
The wild beasts would no doubt get hunted farther and
farther back from the country that man had settled
in.  An interesting fact is that one of the very oldest
of all the Egyptian engravings portrays ostriches,
showing that these great birds were inhabitants of
Egypt at that time, though they do not appear in any
later engravings and are, of course, not living in any
part of Egypt now.  These ostriches are carved on
the face of a sandstone rock, standing as nature placed
it, and not worked into any building.  It is near a
place which in the old days was called Silsilla, and it
was nearly at the southern end of the Egypt of those
times.  For that Egypt did not extend nearly as far
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
south as the country which we call by that name now.
It ended at the first cataract, where is now the town
called Assouan.  In ancient times this Assouan was
called Syene.  Farther south than this, the country
was no longer called Egypt, but Nubia, though some
Egyptians inhabited the region a little south of the
cataract.  Look at your map and you will very likely
see that region still written down as the "Nubian
Desert."  Look to the west of the line of the Nile and
you may read "Libyan Desert."  Look to the right,
again, and there is "Arabian Desert."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Nile
</span>
</p>

<p>
You will realise now what this means: that these
people were here living all along the banks of the great
river, and that on either side were deserts&mdash;sandy,
barren wastes&mdash;which, for all they knew, stretched
away without end.  They lived along this narrow and
very fertile strip which depended almost entirely on
the river for its fertility, and which that river fertilised
in a very peculiar way.
</p>

<p>
At a certain time in the year it came down in a great
flood and inundated, that is to say, flowed over, all the
low land lying on either side of its course.  This
happened just about the season that the star which we
call Sirius, or the Dog-Star, but which they called
Sothis, or the star of their god Seth, showed itself
above the horizon at the moment of sunrise; and
they dated the beginning of their year from this rising
with the sun of this exceedingly bright and large star.
This occurred in middle summer, so that the beginning
of their year, their "New Year's Day," was very
different from ours.  It came nearly at the season of
our Midsummer's Day.  But they had a very good
reason for counting the beginning of their year from
it, because it was such a very important date for them.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
It really did begin a new year for them, for it was this
inundation, or overflow of the river, which gave their
seeds, when they put them into the ground, a chance
of growing and giving them good crops.  After a time,
during which the water had lain out over the low land,
it fell back again into the usual channel of the river
and left all the land which it had covered with a
deposit, or layer, of rich dark mud, better than any
manure they could have given it.
</p>

<p>
We know now what it was that caused, and that
still every year causes, this overflow; it is the
excessively heavy rainfall which occurs annually in the
interior of the country, where the sources of the river
are.  But they did not know the reason, and made
many curious guesses to account for it.
</p>

<p>
Although there were these deserts around them, it
seems certain that the country quite close about the
river had more trees and bushes on it than it has now.
For one thing, as the people settled in the country and
their numbers grew, they would be likely to clear off
patches of the woodland for their crops, and in the
second place a great eating down of the vegetation
must have happened when they began, as we know
they did begin, to keep goats and, later, camels.
</p>

<p>
The long-necked camels would be able to reach up
to the tops of small trees, and to the lower branches
of the taller ones, and, together, it seems that the
goats and camels made a great difference after a while
in the number of the trees.  When a country is much
stripped of its trees, one of the results is that less rain
falls there; so it is quite sure that this stripping of
the trees by the goats and camels in Egypt caused
the rainfall to be less than it had been before those
creatures were brought in.  The country had to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
depend more than ever, for its crops, on the overflow
of the river.  Of course the cutting down of the trees
by carpenters with the stone or bronze axes would
help to reduce the numbers, and we know that the
ancient Egyptians understood the use of charcoal,
which is made by burning wood.  So it is easy to
understand that, in a country which had no great
supply of woodland to start with, what there was of
it was soon almost destroyed.
</p>

<p>
But until that destruction happened there was
woodland enough to give shelter to numbers of wild
animals.  Many of the animals which the early Egyptians
hunted were of kinds that are able to live in sandy
places where there is very little shelter, and, as it seems,
very little grass for them to eat.  We find, by the old
carvings and written records, that they hunted the
lion, leopard, jackal, wild boars, antelopes of many
kinds, wild sheep and oxen, the hippopotamus in the
river, and that they caught a variety of fish in the river
and in the Lake Moeris, into which water was led from
the river by a canal.  The making of canals, to carry
the water to places where it was required, was done
in very early days, and at the season of the river's
overflow water was led by a canal into this big lake
which acted as a reservoir, or storing place, for the
water, from which they could draw it off when wanted.
The crocodiles, by which the Nile was infested, were
looked on as sacred.
</p>

<p>
They understood the use of nets for fishing, and
used nets also for surrounding four-footed animals
and for catching birds.  For the killing of the larger
and dangerous animals they had spears of various
make, and bows and arrows.  It is doubtful whether
they used the boomerang&mdash;that wooden, flat, curved
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
weapon, used still by the natives of Australia, which
returns to the thrower after going out to a distance
of more than a hundred yards.  There are carved
figures which look as if they might be figures of
boomerangs, but they might be "throwing sticks" such as
some savage people still use to give greater length of
"leverage"&mdash;if you know what that means&mdash;to increase
the length and force of their throw of a spear.  There
were immense numbers of wild-fowl about the river
and the marshes.  So the ancient Egyptians must
have had splendid sport.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Domestic animals
</span>
</p>

<p>
They seem to have kept, as domestic animals,
ducks and geese, but it was not till several thousand
years later than the date of those engravings in which
we see the ostriches that our domestic fowls were
introduced.  Hairy-coated sheep are shown on some
of the early carvings, but later a better sort of sheep,
with woollier coat, and curved, instead of straight,
horns appears.  They had oxen, which drew their
wooden ploughs and trod out the corn from the straw
on the threshing-floors, and were also used to draw
weights.  They had, after a time, as we have seen,
goats and camels, but the donkey was the most common
beast of burden, both when they traversed the desert
and when they were in their own fertile strip of country.
Horses were only brought in at rather a late date in
the story.  At first they seem to have been used only
for drawing chariots, and we find them thus harnessed
a long while before we are shown a rider mounted on
a horse, or, indeed, on any animal.  They do not seem
to have known either the elephant or the giraffe,
which are perhaps the most remarkable creatures in
all Africa.  We know that they kept bees for their
honey.  They had dogs, of a variety of breeds, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
used them for hunting, apparently not regarding them
as the unclean creatures that most people in the East
consider them now.  They kept cats and monkeys as
pets, and used the cats to catch birds.
</p>

<p>
But the great business of their lives was the cultivation
of their crops.  Egypt was a great corn-producing
country.  Make a note of that in your minds, for the
corn supply of Egypt became of great importance in
the later story of the Mediterranean and its shores.
</p>

<p>
The corn was principally of the kinds that we call
wheat and barley.  And they had vegetables, such
as lettuce, beans, peas, onions, and so on.  We may
imagine a certain amount of sowing and hoeing, and
weeding and harvesting going on at the right seasons;
but a great deal of their time must have been taken up
with the watering under the scorching Egyptian sun.
When the big flood had ceased to come down from the
rain-filled lakes in the south, and the river had gone
back into its ordinary channel, they had, after a while,
to refresh the ground again by raising water in buckets
hung by a rope to a long pole.  The pole worked on a
hinge about three-quarters of the way down from the
end to which the rope was fastened, so that the bucket
could be let down or drawn up by a man working at
the end of the pole.  There are many pictures and
carvings of this apparatus.  Probably very little rain
fell at any part of the year in Egypt itself after most of
the trees had gone.
</p>

<p>
They had the palm trees on which the dates grow,
and fig trees and pomegranates.  The wood of the
palm must have been useful to them for timber, in a
country where timber trees were so scarce.  And they
had the flax, of which they made linen.  In early days
there does not seem to have been any cultivation of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
the vine, though the wine made in Egypt became quite
important later.  And they had the papyrus.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br>
CYPERUS PAPYRUS.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The papyrus
</span>
</p>

<p>
The papyrus was a plant which grew wild in the
marshes, and it was of the greatest importance to
them, and also to us, because it was on strips cut from
the stalk and fastened flat together that the substance
was made which served them for paper, on which very
much of the story which I am now telling you was
written.  I have said that much of the story is taken
from the writings and pictures on stone, whether on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
the rocks as they stood where nature had put them,
or as the stone was worked into the tombs or
monuments of kings and great people, into pyramids and
the like.  But the greatest part of the record is written
on the papyrus.  The stem of the plant was used also
for the building of boats, and it supplied them with
material for ropes.  Though it was found wild, they
cultivated it, and so increased the natural supply.
</p>

<p>
It is likely that their houses were commonly built
of brick.  You will have noticed that as the country
was so poorly supplied with timber-trees few wooden
houses could be built.  But the brick of which the
houses of most of the people were made would not be
of the brick that we know.  You will remember that
one of the burdens imposed on the Israelites in Egypt
was to make bricks "without straw," and it may have
happened to you to wonder at that, because, as you
know, our bricks are not made with straw.  But
straw and pieces of reed were used in the making of
much of the ancient brick, because the clay often was
not burnt in a kiln, but only dried by the sun's heat.
This did not give nearly so hard or lasting a brick as
the brick that was burnt by the fire in a kiln, but a
mixture of the straw helped to hold the clay together
and to prevent its crumbling.
</p>

<p>
They knew all about the proper burning of bricks,
to make them durable, also, but this sun-drying was
a less troublesome way, and was used for the commoner
kind of brick.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Works of art
</span>
</p>

<p>
At a very early period they became skilful in the
making of pottery, by which I mean vessels for household
use, such as jugs, etc., in clay, and they were
clever workers of glass.  They made ornaments of
gold, and engraved jewels.  They were interested in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
medicine, and knew the use of splints for setting broken
bones.  They knew something of the movement of
the stars, as seen from the earth.  We have noticed
that they began their New Year at the date of the rising
of Sothis, as they called the Dog-Star, about the season
that the Nile began to rise.  The carvings and drawings
on stone and on papyrus are remarkable, even from the
first, for the correctness and firmness of the outline.
The earliest show the hands and feet left in a curiously
unfinished state, and many of the figures have the two
legs shown as one.  As time went on they came to
draw the figure very much more perfectly and with
attention to finishing the hands and feet.  The faces
indicate quite clearly the race of men to which the
originals of the portraits belonged.
</p>

<p>
But, of course, the achievements of the old Egyptians
by which they are best known to us are those
gigantic monuments the Pyramids, that strange head
of the Sphinx, the many temples and the mummied
corpses found within them.  All these, as well as their
hieroglyphical or picture writing, are connected very
closely with their religious beliefs; and this is such a
very curious and interesting subject that I propose to
write about it in a chapter of its own.
</p>

<p>
I do not know whether you will agree, but it seems
to me that the story of mankind is much more amusing,
and will do us much more good, if we try to see how the
peoples of the world lived from time to time, what kind
of people they were, and how they worked and played
and fought, rather than if we just study a list of the
names of their kings and of their towns.  I do not
think the names can help us much, unless we know
what the people that the names belonged to did, or
what happened in the towns so called.  For that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
reason I have avoided mentioning any names that do
not seem to have that kind of interest in the story.  I
think they only confuse us and get in the way of our
seeing how the things happened that really did make
a difference in the world.
</p>

<p>
But you are not to suppose that when these
Egyptian people had settled themselves down along
the course of this pleasant river, they were allowed
to remain there quite peaceably, without any interference
from their neighbours who lived in a far less
fertile and agreeable country.  The greatest of all
facts in Egypt was the Nile.  It went from end to
end of the country.  People went along it in boats
and ships, they fished in it, hunted the hippopotamus,
and possibly the crocodile, in it.  Sometimes they were
killed by either of these, and especially by the latter.
The Nile was their life.  Without it they would have
died.
</p>

<p>
There was desert all about them, but it was not
desert so deserted that it was quite without inhabitants.
There were "oases," or fertile patches, in the desert
itself, and the deserts had their limits; there were
tolerably fertile lands beyond them again.  And it
has always been a wonder how the desert-dwellers,
such as the Arabs and some kinds of antelopes, do
manage to subsist where there seems to be so little
for them to eat, and almost nothing for them to drink.
</p>

<p>
But there were people&mdash;Libyans on the west,
Nubians on the south, Ethiopians (what we should
call negroes)&mdash;of various tribes who probably were
envious enough of the easy life that they saw their
neighbours living along the river-bank.  Therefore,
although it sounds as if it were a very peaceful, as well
as pleasant, life that I have tried to show you that these
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
ancient Egyptians were leading, you are not to suppose
that they were not beset, from time to time, by
incursions and invasions and attacks by the peoples
round about them.  It would take far too long to
recite all these invasions against which they succeeded
more or less in holding their own.  That they were
not always successful is quite evident from the records.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The First Dynasty
</span>
</p>

<p>
The record of Egyptian kings is given to us by an
Egyptian priest, named Manctho, and the date of the
earliest king, the founder of what is called the First
Dynasty, has been estimated by some students to have
been as far back as 5500 years before Christ was born.
That is to say, more than seven thousand years ago.
Other learned men have supposed the date of this
first king to be quite two thousand years later in the
story.  This shows the very great difficulty of fixing
the dates of these events that happened so very long
ago.
</p>

<p>
What is more important is that we know at least
one of the great acts of this first Egyptian king, whose
name was Menes.  It is known, from inscriptions, that
he united into one kingdom what had, before him,
been two countries, Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt.
</p>

<p>
And here I must warn you of a difficulty which
may perplex you.  On the map you may see that
Lower Egypt is the part near the Delta, that is the
mouth, or mouths, of the Nile where it flows into the sea.
Upper Egypt is the more southern part reaching as far
south as the first cataract.  But, as you look at the
map, this Lower Egypt looks upper, to your eye.  You
must not pay any attention to that, but must remember
that the northern part must be lower, really, because
it is the part towards which the river runs; and a
river, as you know, must run from higher ground to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
lower.  Remember, then, that Lower Egypt is the
northern part, near the sea and Upper Egypt the
southern.
</p>

<p>
Menes united these into one kingdom, but they were
separated for a time again, under later kings, and this
shows that not only were the Egyptians sometimes at
war with the tribes from the deserts, who invaded them,
but also that the people along the river-banks were
sometimes fighting among themselves.
</p>

<p>
By a dynasty is meant both the king who is the
founder, the first, of that dynasty, and also those of
his children and grandchildren, or relatives, who followed
him on the throne.  It is as we may speak of the
Stuart dynasty or the Hanover dynasty, of our own
kings.  When there were no more relations of a
dynasty to come to the throne, or when one king was
conquered by a foreign invader, or by a revolution of
his own subjects, the next king was called the founder
of a new dynasty, which went on till his family also
died out or was turned out.
</p>

<p>
In the long history of Egypt, from the time of Menes,
the founder of the first dynasty, to the conquest of
Egypt by Alexander of Macedon in 332 B.C.&mdash;that is,
332 years before the birth of Christ&mdash;there were thirty-one
of these dynasties, or kingly families, which ruled
Egypt one after the other.
</p>

<p>
We speak of the rulers of all these dynasties as
kings, but it is evident that they did not all have the
same authority over their subjects.  In our own
history we know that sometimes the barons were very
powerful, and the king of England had great difficulty
in keeping them under his rule.  Something of the
same kind happened at various times in Egypt.  There
were local chiefs, with a large following of men, who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
were nearly independent of the actual king.  But in
the end the kings regained the authority over them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The new empire
</span>
</p>

<p>
The capital city, in the earliest times, was
Memphis, in Lower Egypt, and so it remained until the
ninth and tenth dynasties, when the power of the
Memphis kings was overthrown by conquerors from
the north, and the country was distracted by revolutions,
so far as we can learn, for a long period.  Then
a people called the Hyksos, coming from the north-east,
from Syria, invaded Egypt and established their
power there for many generations.  And then came a
new dynasty, which is thought to have arisen from a
combining together of the chief men in Upper Egypt,
of which Thebes was the capital.  This rising drove
out the foreign Hyksos and gave a military strength
to Egypt which it never had before.  The greatest
king of this the greatest period of Egypt in the old
days was Tethmosis III.  He was a stepson of
Hatshepsut, the wife of his father Tethmosis II., and
Hatshepsut herself ruled as queen until Tethmosis
came of age.  That was in, or about, 1500 B.C.
</p>

<p>
The date of the founding of this, the eighteenth,
dynasty was 1580 B.C.; and with this period begins
what is called the New Empire.  The word "empire,"
taking the place of that of kingdom, seems to show
that the Egyptians were claiming to extend their
power beyond their own country.  And we know that
they actually did so.
</p>

<p>
I do not want, for the moment, to follow down the
story of Egypt any further than this, because it is
time that we turned our eyes eastward, to see what
was going on along that other great river-fed region,
where the Euphrates and the Tigris flow down together.
The point which we have now come to in the Egyptian
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
story is a point at or about which new and great things
began to happen.  The two great world forces&mdash;that
of Egypt on the one side and that of Babylonia, which
is the name given to the empire established in the east,
on the other&mdash;began to clash together as they had not
clashed before.  Their rivalry, and the wars between
them, and the catching up into these wars and the
squeezing between them of the unfortunate smaller
peoples that lived in the country by which the two big
empires were divided&mdash;these are the principal things
in the story of the world for a thousand years and more
after the time of the founding of the eighteenth
dynasty.  So we must now try to make out something
of the story of that other great power along those more
eastern rivers.
</p>

<p>
But before we go to that eastern story I want to
put in a chapter, the chapter that I spoke of a few
pages back, to tell you something about the religion
of the old Egyptians, the strange gods that they
worshipped, the burial of their dead, their tombs, their
language, and their sacred writing or hieroglyphic.
</p>

<p>
I think, however, before we begin the new chapter,
I should like you to take a look at the map again and
observe the position of the two great river-courses&mdash;the
western, which we have been talking about, and the
eastern, to which we are soon to come&mdash;because these
are the real big facts which matter in the world's story.
The Egyptian religion and all connected with it are
most interesting, but the clash of the big empires
was what made the early history of the world.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The two empires
</span>
</p>

<p>
You will see, then, these great river regions and
will imagine the two powerful empires established in
them, and then you will see that there lies between
the two a country in which lies the land of Palestine,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
where the Jews lived.  You will see that the big
empires are divided from each other, nearly separated,
by the Red Sea running up into the land with
two arms, the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Akaba.
Between these two stretches or arms lies the Sinai
Peninsula, and northward of Egypt and westward of
Palestine there is the Mediterranean Sea.  The result
of this distribution of sea and land is that the only
way by which the two big empires could come into touch
with one another was by way of Palestine.  The
southern desert, even where those big arms of the sea
did not run up into it, was almost as impassable for
the passage of armies as the sea itself.  Neither of the
empires, in the early days, had much of a fleet, by which
they could get at one another across sea.  The
consequence is that we have to regard that stretch of land
which is occupied on the map by Palestine as the
bridge, and the only bridge, by which they could
come into contact, either for purposes of trade or of
war.
</p>

<p>
It is only natural to think, therefore, that when
they began, as they did in the eighteenth Egyptian
dynasty, to make big wars on each other, the tribes
that held, or that vainly tried to hold, that bridge,
would be terribly squeezed and harassed by first one
and then the other of the big neighbours coming upon
them, with very little respect for their rights.  That
is, in fact, exactly what we know did happen.  And
it is only a wonder that the Jews at that time were
not squeezed utterly out of existence between the two.
It is one of the biggest wonders, as well as one of the
biggest facts, in history that they were not so squeezed
out.  When I say it is one of the biggest facts, I mean
that it made an enormous difference to the history of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
the world, for if they had allowed themselves to be
squeezed out, if they had not even then showed that
extraordinary toughness and tenacity which has
always been a great part of their national character,
the history of the world would have been very different
from what it has been, Christianity could not have
spread through the world as it has spread, and the
whole course of events would have been largely
changed.
</p>

<p>
In what way it would have been changed we cannot
say; but that it would have been changed enormously
we cannot doubt.
</p>

<p>
Keep, then, these great facts clearly in your minds:
the position of these two big empires to west and east,
and the comparatively narrow bridge between them,
by which they could communicate with each other.
If you have this, like a map without any of the other
names filled in, in the background of your minds, you
will be able to fit in the happenings as they occur.
</p>

And now for our chapter on the Egyptian religions,
beliefs, customs, and so on.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
EGYPTIAN RELIGIONS, SACRED WRITINGS, ETC.
</h3>

<p>
Talking, if you will carefully think of it, you will find
to be just sending messages to one another by means
of sounds.  You learned to talk&mdash;that is to say, to send
messages in this way&mdash;when you were a child, before
you learned to write.  So did the early Egyptians and
all early peoples.  But the difference between you and
them is that you had some one to teach you to write,
and they had not.  They had to invent a way of doing
this for themselves.
</p>

<p>
When you were a child you saw the sun rising,
winter and summer following each other, and all the
rest of the events in Nature, and you had some one to
tell you how they all happened.  The early Egyptians
and the others saw all these things, but they had no
one to tell them how they happened.  They had to
puzzle them out, or try to do so, for themselves.
</p>

<p>
They saw that such things were entirely beyond
the power of any mere man to make to happen; therefore
they attributed the happenings to some invisible
power or powers immensely stronger and more gifted
than themselves.  And of course they were perfectly
right in so doing.  Only the mistake, or one of the
mistakes, they made was this: they imagined each
of the greatest marvels that they saw to be caused by
a power which was busied with that particular marvel.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
Thus they thought that it was one power which made
the corn to grow in the spring-time, for instance;
another power that caused the sun to rise in the
morning, and so on.  They would see the flowing of a
river, with its appearance of being a live thing as it
went along, now smooth, now rippling, and they would
go so far as to imagine that each stream had its own
particular power or god looking after it.
</p>

<p>
Or they might actually look on the marvellous
thing as itself a god.  The sun, for instance, which
they saw to give them light and warmth and to be a
very splendid object&mdash;many races thought, and not
unnaturally, that the sun itself was a god, and a very
great god.  They saw the moon, and to some of them
it seemed that the moon was a power not unlike the
sun, but less strong, and so it occurred to them that
perhaps the moon was a goddess and the wife of the
great god the sun.  But the Egyptians, unlike others,
looked on the moon as a male deity.  When they had
gone thus far in guesses about the heavenly bodies,
they did not have to go any great way farther in order
to ascribe all sorts of power&mdash;less than the power of
the sun or of the moon&mdash;to the other planets and stars.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Sacrifices
</span>
</p>

<p>
And, once more, these early, unlearned men, who
had no one to teach them, but had to find out everything
for themselves, saw indeed that they received
great good from, let us say, the warmth of the sun and
the overflowing of the river, and the growing of their
crops, to give them food.  They could worship the
power that they thought had given them all this.
But then, again, they would sometimes find themselves
visited by some dreadful disaster, perhaps an earthquake,
or terrible pestilence, or famine when the river
did not overflow in its usual way.  And these evil
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
things they had to ascribe to some power very much
more strong than themselves.  Thence they got the
idea of evil gods, or devils, as well as of the good and
kind gods.  The idea arose that they must do something
to avert these calamities, by giving to the powers
or gods who caused the calamities something that the
gods would like.  And since men had to think that
the gods would like the things that they themselves
liked, they sacrificed to them, as it was called&mdash;that
is to say, gave them gifts of such things as they
themselves liked best.  It was rather a puzzle, perhaps, to
know how to give a gift to a being who was invisible,
and who would not come and take the gift away;
but they solved that puzzle as best they could.  They
burned some of the gifts, or sacrifices, so that the solid
flesh of the sacrificed creature was turned into smoke
and went up into the air and disappeared.  Or they
poured libation of wine or of blood upon the earth,
where it soaked in.  So in both instances it became
invisible, and therefore it might be supposed that it
had been accepted by the invisible god.
</p>

<p>
And then, finally, there is this other point that I
want you to notice about the speculations, or guesses,
of man in his earliest ages, about the powers by
which he was surrounded and which he was trying to
understand&mdash;early man did not distinguish so clearly
as we do between himself and the other animals.  He
regarded them as closely related to himself.  Many of
the Red Indians and other tribes even to-day believe
themselves to be descended from some animal who was
the founder, the first ancestor, of their tribe.  Men of
that tribe will on no account kill an animal of the
species to which they believe that their first ancestor
belonged.  Thus a tribe which believes its ancestor to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
have been a beaver, let us say, would hold all beavers
sacred, would never kill one, and very likely would use
the figure of a beaver as a kind of family crest.  The
beaver would become a kind of god to them, and when
it was looked on in this way it was called the "totem"
of the tribe.
</p>

<p>
I mention this idea of "totem" worship because
it may have been somewhat in this way that the
Egyptians came to consider as sacred such curious,
and so many, animals as they did&mdash;cats, hawks, bulls,
crocodiles, even beetles.  I do not say that it was
thus that the worship of these creatures came to
prevail among the Egyptians.  I do not think that
there is any at all clear evidence that it came about
in this way; but it may have been so, and it is rather
difficult to see how else it grew.
</p>

<p>
You may have noticed that I wrote, for the heading
of this chapter, "religions" in the plural, with an
"s," not "religion."  And this I did because the
religion of the ancient Egyptians was not one.  There
are at least three different lines of religious thought
and speculation to be traced, so tangled up together
that the whole subject becomes very difficult to
understand, but beyond all doubt there are these three.
There is this animal worship; there is the worship of
the sun and moon; and there is the worship of the two
opposed and yet connected powers that bring good
and evil.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Legends of the Gods
</span>
</p>

<p>
The invention, the imagination, of the mind of
early man was disposed to making up stories about
these gods.  If the stories explained the events that
people saw happening, so much the better.  Now there
was a god, by name Osiris, who was first worshipped,
as it seems, only in a town called Busiris.  Near by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
was a town called Buto, where it is thought that a
goddess, to whom they gave the name of Tsis, was
worshipped.  For some reason which we do not know,
the worship of Osiris extended until it spread over the
whole of Egypt, and with it the worship of Isis, who
was supposed to be the wife of Osiris.  The story of
Osiris and Isis was told very differently at different
times and in different places.  According to the Greek
writer, Plutarch, the legend which he heard about
them went thus: that Osiris a very long time ago
reigned as a great king over all Egypt.  He civilised
the people and taught them arts and science.  He
had a wicked brother Seth, who made a conspiracy
against him and killed him, and put his body into a
coffin and threw it into the Nile.  The wife of Osiris,
Isis, after long search, found the body and brought it
back.  Then she went on a visit to her son, Horus,
who lived at Buto; and while she was away the wicked
Seth came back, found the body (mummified, as we
may suppose) of Osiris, took it away and cut it up into
fourteen pieces, so that Isis might never again have it
as a whole body.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-030"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-030.jpg" alt="HORUS, ISIS (WITH HORUS)">
<br>
HORUS, ISIS (WITH HORUS)
</p>

<p>
From that point there seem to be two versions of
the story.  One is that Isis, having found the fourteen
pieces, buried each piece where she found it.  Another
is that she collected the pieces, put them all together
again, and that Osiris, thus made whole again, ruled
in the under-world as king of the dead.
</p>

<p>
Horus, according to one story, later attacked and
slew his uncle, the wicked Seth, to avenge his father;
and in this contest between the good Osiris and the
bad Seth we perhaps see an attempt to account for
the good and evil in the world.  If that is so, the
good finally triumphed in that story, because Horus,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
the good son of the good father, killed the bad
Seth.
</p>

<p>
Another story, however, says that the struggle
between Horus and Seth was so equal that Egypt
was divided between them, Lower Egypt going to
Horus and Upper Egypt to Seth.
</p>

<p>
On the inscriptions, in the hieroglyphic, or sacred
graving, to which we will come directly, Horus is
represented by the figure of a falcon, Seth by that of
some animal which has been variously guessed to be
a jerboa or an okapi, but which looks very much as
if it might be some kind of dog.  It has been
conjectured that the contest recorded between Horus and
Seth may be a growth from wars waged between tribes
represented the one by the falcon and the other by
this four-footed animal of Seth's, whatever it may be.
</p>

<p>
The story, and the different shapes it takes, and the
way in which the incidents get transformed so as to
fit in with the incidents of quite a different story, may
help you to understand something of the way in which
the legends grew.  They not only grew, separately,
into very strange shapes, but they grew into one
another, like neighbouring trees with their branches
inter-tangled, so that it is very hard to distinguish
them.
</p>

<p>
One thing you may have noticed in the story&mdash;that
Osiris, according to one version at least, becomes
king of the dead in the nether world.  That means, of
course, that these people so very long ago believed in
the life of a man's soul after his body was dead.  That
is curious, is it not, seeing that they had had no
revelation, so far as we know, to tell them that it was so?
We may speak of that a little more, in a minute or two.
</p>

<p>
Probably you may have seen pictures of some of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
hieroglyphics or sacred inscriptions, and if you have
you may have noticed that some of the figures have
human bodies and beasts' heads.
</p>

<p>
Thus Horus is often shown with a man's body and
a falcon's head.  Anubis has a man's body and a
jackal's head, and the like happens with many of the
other animal gods.  We may take it all as sign of the
confusion in the minds of these early people with regard
to the difference between gods and man and other
animals.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Various religions
</span>
</p>

<p>
The confusion of religions in Egypt is particularly
great, very likely because different tribes brought in
different beliefs and gods, and they grew confused with
the beliefs and gods already there.  Where they
believed that there was such a great number of gods,
it was almost necessary that the power of each god
must be supposed to be restricted to a certain place.
Otherwise the fighting between them for mastery
would be endless.  We have seen, however, how, as
time went on, the idea grew of Osiris as a god universal
throughout Egypt.  That was a long step forward in
the direction of belief in a single god, ruler and maker
of all the universe.  And yet then a further confusion
arose, which led a step farther again in the same right
direction, when Osiris began to be identified with&mdash;that
is to say, to be considered the same as&mdash;the Sun-god,
whom they called Re or Ra.
</p>

<p>
They had very many and various stories and fancies
about this great god Re, the Sun&mdash;that at dawn he
began to sail across the sky in a boat called the boat of
the dawn, and again, at night, that he got into another
boat, the boat of the dark, and sailed along underneath
the earth all night to catch his morning boat again.
Another story was that he was born a baby in the dawn,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
grew to his full manly strength at midday, and then
declined again into an old man, dying at night.  Stories
of the same sort were invented to account for the
apparent movements of the moon and stars and other
planets.  Of course they had no knowledge of the earth
turning on its own axis, or travelling round the sun.
</p>

<p>
It seems curious enough that Osiris should be at
one time identified with the sun, the god of the heavens,
and yet be the ruler of the under-world, where the souls
of dead men and women went after death.  Perhaps it
seems less curious when we remember that the sun
himself was supposed to sail nightly underneath the
earth.  But it is quite impossible for us to have any
clear idea of how they reasoned about these things,
partly because the accounts we have of it are all very
vague and given to us only by the records of the
inscriptions which survive, and by travellers, like the
Greek Herodotus, to whom the priests would not tell
a great deal, and partly because the ideas of the people
even who held those beliefs must have been very far
from clear.
</p>

<p>
We know that they worshipped a great number of
gods, and different gods in different places.  The bull,
Apis, was a sacred animal which was worshipped
especially at Memphis, the capital of Lower Egypt.
Bast was the cat goddess, worshipped principally at
Bubastis, where thousands of mummied bodies of
cats have been found.  Horus, the falcon; Seth, an
animal not quite clearly identified; and Anubis, the
jackal, I have mentioned already.  And they worshipped
the crocodile, the serpent, the ram, and many
other creatures, but especially the sacred beetle, the
scarabæus, in whose likeness those "scarabs" which
we have in great numbers from Egypt, were made.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
Very often the "scarabs," in stone or glazed pottery,
were engraved with the crests of the kings and used as
seals.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The priests
</span>
</p>

<p>
There were a very great many priests.  Every
town seems to have had its temple to one or other of
the many gods, and there were priests attached to
every temple.  But all the priests were not only
priests and nothing else.  I mean, that they might do
other business as well; rather as if a clergyman here
were to be a tradesman or a lawyer as well as doing his
work in the Church.  Sometimes the principal priest
would be the great man of the district, the chief
land-owner.  But where religions were so many and so
different, the customs must have differed very much
too.
</p>

<p>
During the course of the eighteenth dynasty, with
which the new empire and the great power of Egypt
began, one of the kings tried to do away with all these
different religions and to extend the worship of Osiris,
identified with Ra, the Sun-god, over the whole of
Egypt.  And he succeeded; but his success was only
for a time, and after a short period the Egyptians went
back to the worship of their many gods again.
</p>

<p>
It was very important, in the opinion of the Egyptians,
that the gods at each place, and of each kind,
should be worshipped with the exactly right ceremonies.
If the ceremonies were not rightly performed the god
might be angry and bring all kinds of calamities upon
you.  It seemed to them far more important that these
rites should be properly performed than that those
who performed them should lead very good lives.
They had their laws and their customs which regulated
their conduct, but they do not seem to have feared
that the gods would visit them with punishment in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
this life for any wrong-doing.  They did, however,
consider that any acts of injustice, such as robbery
or dishonesty, would affect the state of their soul
after death.  That would be the business of Osiris,
the ruler of the dead, to look after.  We will speak
of that in a minute.
</p>

<p>
The priests were the people who knew exactly how
the worship of the gods at each place should be
performed.  They could read the religious instructions
which were written in what is called the hieroglyphic&mdash;the
sacred engravings.  The hieroglyphic was probably
the beginning of all writing.
</p>

<p>
If you can imagine a time when writing was
unknown, and when there was need to send
communications from one to another, and that these
communications must not be known to the bearer
of the message, how would you set about doing it?
</p>

<p>
Well, one way, at least, of doing it would be by
sending signs marked on papyrus or parchment or
on a slate, or whatever you might have convenient for
making marks on, and to hope that the man you were
sending them to would be clever enough to
understand what you meant, and that the man by whom
you were sending them would not.  And if you wanted
to send a message about any particular thing, the most
easy and obvious way to begin would be by making
a simple drawing of that thing.  So, if you wanted to
send a message about a bird, you would draw the
figure, or outline, of a bird.  If you wanted to send
a message about an eye, a human eye, you might
draw the figure of an eye.  I suggest these two things
because they are two of the most simple figures that
actually do appear in the picture-writing which is the
old Egyptian hieroglyphic.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
</p>

<p>
Now we can go a step farther.  The eye is the thing
that we see with.  Therefore, if we want to send a
message to our friend and tell him that we "see a
bird," if we put the picture of an eye, which is the
organ of sight, and a bird next to it, our friend, if he
is at all intelligent, may understand the message to
mean "I see a bird."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Three kinds of writing
</span>
</p>

<p>
That, or something like that, may have been&mdash;I
do not say that it was, but I think it most likely&mdash;the
way in which this picture-writing began.  I ought
not to call it picture-writing, really, for it was not that.
<i>Hieros</i> is Greek for sacred, or for a priest; <i>glyphein</i>
is Greek for to grave, or engrave.  So hieroglyphic
meant sacred characters engraved; that is, cut in on
stone.  The word for the sacred writing was hieratic,
meaning simply sacred, without the meaning of
engraving.  The hieratic was written on papyrus.  It
was derived from the hieroglyphic, the hieroglyphic
being the older, but it was not quite the same because
the pictures, so to call them, had become a good deal
simplified so that they could be drawn much more
quickly.  The figures were not so carefully made, and
certain signs, sometimes not very like the original
figures, came to be understood as representing these
figures.
</p>

<p>
That was one alteration from the hieroglyphic
that was made, as time went on; and then there came
another, further change, still in the direction of making
simpler and simpler signs in place of the original
figures; and when this third kind of writing had
established itself it seems to have been found the
easiest of the three and best suited for everyday use.
It was called "Demotic," from "demos," meaning
the populace, whence we get our "democracy" and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
the like words.  "Demotic," then, meant that it was
the writing of the common people, of the nation at
large, as contrasted with the "hieratic," which was
the writing used and known by the priests.
</p>

<p>
All the old religious writings and the instructions
about the ceremonies to be performed at the worship
of the various gods were, of course, in the sacred
writing.  And when the priests added to them they
were careful to do it in their own sacred script.  And
so, by knowing this script, or writing, which the others
did not, they grew to have a knowledge of their
own, which they kept rather jealously to themselves.
It gave them all the greater importance.  And their
importance and power were very great.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Egyptian dress
</span>
</p>

<p>
They were distinguished from the rest of the people,
probably on all occasions, and certainly on the occasions
of performing the religious rites, by a peculiar costume.
The costume in which we see the common people figured
in the earliest engravings is extremely simple.  The
climate was warm and they did not require much
covering.  The dress consists simply in a cloth wound
around the loins and passing between the legs, just as
the most savage peoples in the world to-day wear the
loin-cloth.
</p>

<p>
A little later we find the engravings showing us the
cloth lengthening downward, perhaps as far as the
knees, or even a little lower in the female costume, but
the upper part of the body was generally bare in both
sexes.  Linen woven from the flax, for the art of
weaving was very early known, was the light material of
which this costume was made.
</p>

<p>
And then we find them wearing something not
unlike a night-gown to-day, rather open at the neck,
and without sleeves.  Another variety of the linen
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
dress was as if it were a night-gown with the front
closed up to the neck, but all the right shoulder and
sleeve taken out of it, so that the left shoulder was
covered, but the right arm and shoulder were left all
free.
</p>

<p>
That was the kind of dress of the common people.
At first we see them bare-foot.  Gradually they took
more and more to sandals, and there are pictures of
great men going along bare-foot, but followed by a
servant carrying their sandals&mdash;perhaps to put on
when they came to rough ground.  But it is also
likely that the wearing of the sandals had a meaning
in a religious rite which they might be going to
perform.
</p>

<p>
The head was at first always uncovered; but we
see at one time a fillet, or simple band for the hair,
beginning to be worn; then we come to a curious low
cap, and next to a high, almost mitre-like cap, and
finally to a variety of headgear.  The hair and the
beard are sometimes elaborately curled; but as a
rule the Egyptians were clean-shaven.  The beard,
however, was recognised as so important in some of
the religious ceremonies that it is said that a false
beard was sometimes worn on these sacred occasions.
It is rather like the wearing of wigs by our judges and
barristers in Court.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the great eighteenth dynasty,
we find the longer gowns, which are like our night-gowns,
worn more and more, and the priestly garments
and those of the great men becoming more and more
rich and long.  Likely enough this change was due to
the closer intercourse which the Egyptians now began
to have with the Eastern Empire, where the longer and
richer garments were commonly worn.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
</p>

<p>
But, after all, when you hear or read the words
Ancient Egypt, what, at first, do you begin to think
of?  I know what ideas the words first suggest to
me&mdash;pyramids and mummies.  They are both so
extraordinary and unlike what we find in other
countries.  And they both have rather the same meaning
at the back of them, namely, that the Egyptians paid
a very great respect to the bodies of the dead.  For
the mummifying was, of course, to preserve the body,
and the pyramids were only one form of the immense
and immensely expensive tombs which they built for
the mummies to be laid in.
</p>

<p>
And I do not want you to be misled by something
that I wrote a few pages back about the Egyptians
not supposing that the favour of the gods was to be
won by good behaviour, but rather by very exact
ritual and ceremonies.  That is true, but I also said
then that they did think that the behaviour of a
person while alive made a great difference to his future
after death.
</p>

<p>
That is a fact that we may be quite certain of.
There is a very famous old Egyptian book, called
<i>The Book of the Dead</i>, illustrated with pictures
showing all that happened, after his death, to a certain
illustrious Egyptian; how he passed through several
gates, each guarded by its own horrible demons, how
he arrived at the great judgment-seat at last, and how
there his good deeds in this life were weighed against
his bad, and the good were found to be more than the
bad, so that he was allowed to go on to a place in
which it hardly seems as if he was likely to be very,
very happy, but at least it was far better fortune for
him than if he had been found guilty and been given to
the tormentor.  The tormentor is shown in many of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
the pictures waiting for him.  He is a terrible creature,
with teeth and claws.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Slaves
</span>
</p>

<p>
The inner walls of some of the pyramids are covered
with texts describing events of this kind in the
after-death life of kings.  Some are of such antiquity that
they go back before the uniting into one of the two
kingdoms by Menes; and even in those far-away
times the instructions were lengthy and very precise
about the kind of food and drink, and means of protection
from evil things, that should be buried with the
king for his use in the after-life.  They had much the
same thoughts as we have about the difference between
good conduct and bad.  One of the evil acts which
would most certainly condemn the doer to punishment
after death was oppression of the poor.  Even as long
ago as that it was accounted a virtue to be kindly and
generous to those who had been less fortunate than
yourself.  It seems probable they were a kindly,
rather gentle people, inclined to peace and arts rather
than to war, but compelled to be in a constant state of
defence against the incursions of enemies who lived
in less fertile lands.  In the course of such defence
and resistance many prisoners would be taken.  The
prisoners would be retained alive, as valuable slaves.
It does not follow that because they were slaves they
would be ill-treated.  A kind master would treat a
slave well out of kindness; and a sensible master, even
if he were not kind of heart, would treat a slave well
because the better a slave, like a horse, was fed and
cared for, the more work could be got out of him.
</p>

<p>
And that brings us again to the pyramids and the
other great tombs of the kings and temples of the gods;
for it is very certain that but for "slave labour," as
it is called, the building of the pyramids would have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
been an impossibility.  As it is, with all allowance
made for the multitude of the labourers and the
cheapness of their food and of the material for the
building, the pyramids remain perhaps the greatest
wonder of man's making in all the world, especially
when we consider their age and the small engineering
appliances that the builders had for their making.
How they dealt with the huge blocks of stone is a
marvel.
</p>

<p>
You probably know, roughly, the shape of a pyramid.
The largest now standing is the Great Pyramid, or the
Pyramid of Cheops, near Gizeh.  Its base, or lowest and
largest part, covers 13 acres, and its top is 150 feet higher
than the top of St. Paul's Cathedral.  A space of 13 acres
measures about 250 yards each way and well over half
a mile round.  Ask somebody to show you a piece of
ground, near where you live, that is about the size of
13 acres.  Then remember that 150 feet is 50 yards, or
more than the length of two cricket pitches, and imagine
St. Paul's dome all that higher.  With that idea for
the height, and with an idea of the size of the piece of
ground for the size of the base, you may perhaps form
some kind of idea of the immense appearance of this
pyramid rising out of the desert in the clear Egyptian
air.  And the purpose of all this vast construction is
to make a covering over two little burial chambers in
the middle of it all, in which were laid, thousands of
years ago, the mummied bodies of King Cheops and of
the queen who was his wife.
</p>

<p>
This is certainly the biggest pyramid now standing,
and probably the largest ever built; but there are
many pyramids to which reference is made in the
inscriptions or writings which have entirely disappeared.
Probably their materials have been used for other
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
buildings, and sand-storms from the desert have helped
to cover their foundations.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Temples
</span>
</p>

<p>
A temple, in which the pious people might worship,
was often connected with the pyramid.  When this
was so, the temple always seems to have been placed
to the east of the burial pyramid, so that the
worshippers should look towards the body and to the
west.  It was towards the west of the burial chamber
that a passage was made, with a door of exit for the
soul to go out into the under-world.  We have to
remember that even in life the Egyptian king was
regarded as a kind of god.  It is difficult for us to find
our way back into the thoughts of these ancient people,
who saw far less difference than we know that we are
obliged to see between the human nature and the
divine; but we must try to get back into their thoughts,
if we want to understand them.
</p>

<p>
And this, and a great deal more that I have written
in this chapter and in the one before, is true not of the
early Egyptians only, but of early man all the world
over.  I shall not keep you nearly so long in my
description of what went on in the old days along the
Euphrates and Tigris and elsewhere, because a good
deal of what I am telling you now about these old
Egyptians applies to dwellers in those other places.
</p>

<p>
Some of the inscriptions speak of the important
part which a priest accompanying the spirit in the
under-world played in getting the spirit through the
various demon-guarded doors and arguing his case, as
a barrister might, before the judge.  I say spirit, but
in the pictures the body is shown, very substantially.
Of course it was all the more to the priests' advantage
to prove how useful they could be in the after-life, as
well as in this.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
</p>

<p>
The mummies, as you must know, were dead bodies
preserved by putting chemicals into them and over
them, and wrapping them round, and often by painting
their faces, and giving them altogether an appearance
which to us, discovering them after all these years, seems
rather dreadful, but no doubt was much admired.  We
have no record of the time when the Egyptians began
thus to "mummy" their dead; we may almost say
that we have no record of a time when they did not do
so.  There were mummies long before Menes, whose
date, you may remember, has been guessed so early as
5500 years B.C. and so late as 3300 B.C.  At first it
seems as if only kings were mummied.  The kings were
always looked on as semi-divine, and later the people
began to regard the king as being almost identical
with&mdash;almost the same as&mdash;Osiris.  It is as if they
thought that the god came down in spirit to live in the
body of the reigning king.

</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mummies
</span>
</p>

<p>
Later on in the story, many great people, as well as
the kings, were mummied, and yet later again it became
quite common with all classes.  Sacred animals, such
as the cats in Bubastis, hawks in the temples of Horus,
and even crocodiles and quite large creatures, have been
found, mummied, in great numbers.  The art and trade
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
of making mummies was a very important one, and
grew to greater perfection as the artists began to
learn more of the preserving power of chemicals.
Generally, they are the mummies of royal personages
that have come down to us in the best preservation, no
doubt because the greatest care and expense were
given to their embalming.  One of the best is of that
famous king Tethmosis III.  who was the greatest hero
of that greatest eighteenth dynasty up, or down, to
which we have now brought our story.
</p>

<p>
I have said, and you will be ready to agree with it,
that all this care for the dead body shows what high
value the Egyptians placed on the corpse, although life
and the soul had left it.  But they had the idea that the
soul could be brought back again, by incantations, to
go into the body again through the mouth, and so make
the mouth and the legs and other parts move, almost as
they did before death.  That idea explains perhaps
why they took so much pains about keeping the body
perfect.  It may explain why the wicked Seth, in his
malice, cut up the body of Osiris, whom he had
murdered, and scattered the pieces in fourteen
different places, and also why the faithful Isis collected
them and put them all together again.
</p>

<p>
The Egyptians, like other ancient people and like
many savage races to-day, believed that a man
possessed and had in his body, but capable of separation
from it, two souls, or spirits, and perhaps more,
and though that is an idea so very different from ours
it is not very difficult for us to understand a way in
which it might have come into their minds.
</p>

<p>
It has been thought likely by many who have
given much learned and deep attention to the subject,
that the idea arose from what people saw in dreams.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
They would know, perhaps, that a friend of theirs had
gone away on a journey, yet they might go to sleep,
and see, in a dream, the friend beside them.  What
were they likely to think?  They had not our
knowledge about dreams, and did not know that all that
they saw in them came from their own fancy.  They
would be very likely to think, then, that their friend,
in his soul or spirit with something that looked like
his body, really had come and had stood beside them,
although what we should call his real self was far away.
They would say, then, that he had a second self, or spirit,
which could be in one place and doing one thing while
his other self was in another place and doing quite a
different thing.  Thus they might get the idea of one
kind of soul and body which would be different from
the man whom they actually saw and spoke to when
they were awake.
</p>

<p>
And then, when a friend had died, had gone through
that great change which we call death, they would
often, still in dreams, see him again, as he had been in
life, though they knew that his body had not moved
from the place where it had been buried.  Other
friends might be able to assure them as to this.
Therefore they might say, "Here is another self or spirit of
my friend, who is dead, which I saw come and do this
or that.  It is the soul not of a living man, but of a
dead man."  Thus the idea might arise of a second
soul different from that which was seen while the friend
was alive.
</p>

<p>
You must understand that I am not saying that it
certainly was thus that the idea of more than one soul
arose; but it may have been in this way.  It is a way
in which we can easily see that it might have come into
their minds.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
</p>

<p>
Many of the old writings and inscriptions give
instructions about the prayers and ceremonies and
forms of words to be used for bringing back the soul
into the dead body, and these, of course, were best
understood by the priests.  This, again, helped to make
the priests very important persons.  The greatest
people in the land performed the priests' duties; and
some of what we may call professed priests, those
whose whole business was the performance of these
rites and ceremonies, became the greatest people.
Also some of these very same people acted as judges
and decided points of law, and gave punishments for
the breaking of the laws.  You may realise, then, how
extensive their power was.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Laws
</span>
</p>

<p>
We do not know a great deal about their laws, but
it is singular that all we do know shows that they
had very much the same ideas as to what was right or
wrong as we have.  The king issued decrees.  We find
decrees against the oppression of the poor by the large
landowners.  Crime was punished by death, by fines,
by mutilation, such as by cutting off the nose or by
the infliction of other wounds, and by banishment out
of the kingdom.  They had their codes of laws, for
they are referred to in inscriptions, but the codes
themselves have not been found.
</p>

<p>
I do not know whether this short account will help
you to get a picture into your minds of the life of the
ancient Egyptians.  A large part of the picture should
be filled by the religious ceremonies, by the worship of
the gods and by the offerings which had to be made, at
stated times, to the souls of dead relations.  The
power and the number of the priesthood became so
great as to rival that of the king, and actually one of
the ruling dynasties was set up by the priest class itself.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
</p>

<p>
So now, with that picture, such as I have been able
to set it before your minds, of the people living along
the Nile, let us go eastward and see what was being
done all that while along the courses of the Tigris and
Euphrates.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
BABYLONIA.
</h3>

<p>
If you will look at the map once more you will see
that the Euphrates and the Tigris draw together near
their outgoing into the Persian Gulf and flow together
as one stream.  It was not always so, however.  At
the earliest times of which we have any knowledge at
all the sea stretched up northward into the land to a
point at which the two rivers ran in separate channels,
so that each went out by its own mouth into the gulf.
</p>

<p>
I told you that I did not mean to make this story
about the eastern rivers nearly as long as that about
the Nile.  There are two reasons for this.  In the first
place there is not so much to tell.  The records are not
so many nor so full.  The cause of that is plain.  Egypt
is a land well furnished with hard stone, granite, and
the like.  In the land which we will call Babylonia
there is very little stone.  Therefore the builders built
with brick.  The inscriptions were engraven on brick.
And brick is not so long lasting a material as stone.
It does not take the mark of the graving tool as sharply
at the first cutting, and it is more liable to wear away in
the course of years.  Moreover, the climate of Egypt,
in its upper part at least, is so dry that it is probably
the best preserving climate in the world&mdash;the climate
in which inscriptions on stone or papyrus would last
and keep fresh longer than in any other.  For these
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
reasons we have more records from Egypt than from
Babylonia.
</p>

<p>
But that is only a part, and the smaller part, of the
whole reason why this story that we are telling now
may be told more shortly.  The larger reason is that a
good deal of it has been told already in the Egyptian
story.  There is no need for me to go back and re-tell
you the history of these Babylonians living through
their ages of stone weapons, bronze weapons, and iron
weapons, and through their hunting stage, their flock-keeping
stage, and their agricultural stage; there is no
need to tell this, for it was told to you about the
Egyptians, and it is the story common to all mankind
as they lived and worked their way up from the most
primitive conditions to civilisation.
</p>

<p>
You must please take all that for granted, as being
true of the Babylonians as of the rest of the world.
You may imagine, too, that the same puzzles beset
them as beset the Egyptians when they began to wonder
how things, including themselves, had happened&mdash;how
the world had come into being and what the sun,
moon, and stars were, and so on.  They, like the
Egyptians, wondered about the invisible forces by which
they found themselves surrounded and more or less
controlled.  They made rather different answers to
the puzzles, but the puzzles were the same.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br>
ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MACHINE FOR RAISING WATER <br>
(PRESENT-DAY &quot;SHADOOF&quot;).
</p>

<p>
And so a great deal of the life-story of the
Egyptians, of their way of living and so on, may be
considered to be the way that the Babylonians followed
also.  What will perhaps bring the life of the
Babylonians most clearly before your eyes will be to see,
so far as we can, the chief differences between their
lives and the lives of those old Egyptians.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Water-raising
</span>
</p>

<p>
Both nations lived along river-courses&mdash;we have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
seen that.  And both were very dependent on the overflow
of the rivers for the fertilisation of their fields and
for the growth of their crops.  But, though this was in
a measure true of both, the dependence of the Egyptians
on the overflow of the Nile was much more complete
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
than the dependence of these others on the overflow of
the Euphrates and Tigris.  Those rivers were not so
punctual in the date of the overflow, and the difference
between their lowest and highest flow was not so great
as in the Nile.  Both countries, however, depended
largely on irrigation, that is to say, on leading the water
by canals from the main rivers to the fields where it
was wanted.  Egypt, even when it had more trees than
it has now, had probably less rainfall than Babylonia;
but in both countries the rivers were the sources and
givers of their food supply.
</p>

<p>
We have seen the Egyptians living along a river
which went down between desert country, barren
country, on either side.  The country on either side
the courses of the Euphrates and Tigris was not nearly
so barren and desert as that which lay about the Nile.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The neighbouring states
</span>
</p>

<p>
But now it becomes necessary to look at the map
again.  If you will do so you will see just how this
Babylonia is situated in relation to the countries
round about it.  I speak of it as Babylonia, and speak
of the "other countries," but you are not to suppose
that even at the latest date to which we have brought
down the story at present men had at all the same
distinct idea that we have now about where one
country ended and another began.  You may have
heard of "boundary commissions," meaning committees
of men appointed to trace out the boundary
line between two countries.  The nations we are
speaking of had no boundary commissions: they had
no clear idea of boundaries, or of one nation having a
right to live and to bear rule up to a certain point or
line and no farther.  It was all very shifting, and one
nation took from another what it could get.
</p>

<p>
The shifting perhaps did not matter so much in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
those days, because people had not learnt to look on
their homes as very settled, or lasting.  A good many
of those among whom the story is to take us now were,
if not dwellers in tents themselves, at least the
descendants of those who had dwelt in tents only a
generation or two before.
</p>

<p>
But a look at the map will show you that this
country, which we may call, in a general way of speaking,
Babylonia, had its bounds, its limits, though it was not
nearly as closely limited as Egypt was between the
deserts.  Babylonia, you will see, has the Mediterranean
Sea on its west, but with Palestine and Syria
between itself and that sea.  On the south there is the
Persian Gulf; and Arabia, which is largely desert
and barren, also lies to the south and south-west.  On
the north, away up towards the sources of the great
rivers, is a wild mountainous region whence, as we shall
see, wild, fierce people were apt to come down to harass
the dwellers in the rich plain.
</p>

<p>
So, on these three sides we find Babylonia bounded,
though the boundaries are large as compared with the
narrow boundaries of the people along the Nile; but
on the fourth, the eastern side, away towards Persia
and the heart of Asia, there seems no limit whatever,
either of mountain or of desert or of sea.  The
possibilities of peoples coming in by that way seem
without any limit.  In this respect, then, the situations
of the two ancient empires of the world were very
different.
</p>

<p>
I am speaking of all this country as Babylonia, and
it may occur to you to wonder at that because you
will have heard so much from your Bibles of the
Assyrians coming upon Palestine from this very
country round about the Euphrates.  And so they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
did; and at one period in the story the Assyrians
became so powerful that they took possession of all
this land, and just at that time it would be more
correct to call the land Assyria instead of Babylonia.
But this was for a period only.  At the beginning of
our knowledge of this region Assyria was only a province,
a northern province, of Babylonia, and was ruled from
Babylon.  But the Assyrians became very strong and
revolted, and conquered those who had been their
masters, and it was during this victorious period that
they made those incursions into Palestine of which the
Bible tells us.  But at length the Babylonians, their
old masters, rose up against them and got the mastery
over them again, and after this blaze of glory Assyria
sinks back into its old place as a province of Babylon,
in the northern part of the empire.
</p>

<p>
Now who were they, where did they come from&mdash;the
earliest of the people whom we find to have lived
in Babylonia?  We do not quite know that.  What it
is quite useful to note, however, is that we do seem to
know who they were not.  They were not Semites&mdash;not
a Semitic people.  It is useful to know they were not
this, because Semitic is just what most of the people
whom we now meet in the human story were.
</p>

<p>
The name comes from Shem, the name of one of the
sons of Noah in the book of Genesis; and the so-called
Semites appear, coming into the story of mankind,
out of Arabia, that strange desert country.  They
came up thence into Babylonia, and in Babylonia,
when they came to it, there was already a people with
a high civilisation, as we know by evidences that have
been found.  It was different from the civilisation of
the Semitic people.  The name given to that earlier
people and that earlier civilisation is Sumerian, and I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
really do not think you need trouble to inquire precisely
what is meant by that, for even the most learned have
very little to tell us about it.  It had to have a name.
Let us call it Sumerian, and say it was different from
the Semitic, probably older, and so leave it.
</p>

<p>
It is a curious thing about these Semites, who at a
very early date came in and took possession of all
Babylonia, that though they apparently came from
Arabia and the south, they made their first appearance
in history in the north of Babylonia.  How that
happened we cannot tell.  Perhaps some records of a
southern invasion have been lost.  Or they may have
skirted round on the eastern side.  It is all
guess-work.  They appeared in the north, and they quickly
overran the country&mdash;not only of Babylonia, but of
Palestine and of Syria also&mdash;except, it may be, a strip
of Syria along the Mediterranean shore which is called
on the map Phœnicia.  That is an exception which
you will do well to bear in mind.  It is important,
because these Phœnicians belonged to one of the
greatest civilisations of the old world, and because
they too were great makers of history, as you shall
see before very long.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
"Ur of the Chaldees"
</span>
</p>

<p>
On their western border, therefore, the people of
the powerful empire which began to be formed along
the Tigris and Euphrates had tribes very closely
akin to themselves.  On the east and on the north
they had neighbours of a different race from their
own.  It seems to have been in the south of Babylonia,
near the outgoing of the great rivers, that the first
capital of the empire was formed.  Probably this
southern Babylonia is that "Ur of the Chaldees" from
which we are told that Abraham came and established
himself in Palestine.  He came, as we see, living with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
his family and his dependants in tents, with flocks and
herds, easily moving on from one place to another
when the sheep or oxen had eaten the grass or when
water failed.  He was the patriarch (<i>pater</i>=father,
and <i>arch</i>=ruler), the father-ruler of the small tribe
or large family that came with him.  In your history
books you will sometimes read that "society was in
the patriarchal stage."  That means that the people
of whom the historian is writing were living in the way
in which Abraham and his dependent people lived;
and we may be sure that it was the way of life of the
greater number of those Semites who came up from
Arabia and took possession of Syria and Palestine at a
very early date.  They took possession of the country
of Babylonia also, and as they settled along the fertile
river-banks we may imagine that they would begin to
unite together into a nation and become strong, with a
feeling of union, in a way that it was not at all likely
that the small tribes of patriarchs and their families,
moving about with their flocks and herds, would unite.
So the Babylonians and the Syrians and the dwellers
in Palestine would easily fall into the way of regarding
each other as of different nations, although really they
were of the same race.
</p>

<p>
There would be this difference, then: the settlers
along the rivers really would begin to lead settled
lives, like the people who tilled the soil in Egypt, but
beyond those limits there would be wanderers, with
their cattle&mdash;wanderers for the most part of the same
race as the settlers, but growing more and more
distinct and divided from them in manners and feelings
as time went on and they lived such different lives.
</p>

<p>
I spoke of these Babylonians having just the same
puzzles presented to their minds by what we call "the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
forces of Nature" as the Egyptians had, but said that
they answered them a little differently.  The Egyptians,
as we saw, tried three different kinds of answer.  They
made a great god of the sun, they made a great god of
Osiris, who was originally just the god of one place
(like many others), and they made gods of all sorts of
animals.  Now, trying to understand the religion of
the ancient Babylonians, we may rule out entirely all
idea of animal worship&mdash;that is to say, the third kind
of answer which the Egyptians made to their puzzles.
It does not seem to have been thought of by the
Babylonians at all.  Let us forget those sacred cats
and crocodiles of the Nile.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Osiris and Ra
</span>
</p>

<p>
And then, having cast them aside, we may see a very
remarkable likeness between the other guesses that the
two peoples made, and the way in which they tried
to work the different guesses in with one another.
For you may remember that the Egyptians, after
forming the idea of Ra, the sun-god&mdash;a god that had
his eye over all the world&mdash;and after imagining Osiris
to be so powerful as to rule divinely over all Egypt:
after they had thus exalted these two gods at the
expense of all the others, they then began to regard
the two as one&mdash;the one being but one form of the
other&mdash;Osiris, as Ra, traversing the heavens, and Ra,
as Osiris, ruling the earth.  And since Ra, the Sun,
was supposed to go under the earth at night, in order
to get back to the east to begin his journey across the
sky again the next morning, there was no great difficulty
in imagining him, again as Osiris, ruling over the dead
in the under-world also.
</p>

<p>
And now, in Babylonia, we find that almost exactly
the same thing happened.  Shamash was their name
for the sun-god, the Egyptians' Ra.  Then there was a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
god whom they called Merodach, or Marduk: he was
the god of Babylon.  But Babylon was not always
a great city.  The earliest capital city was south of
Babylon.  So Marduk was only as one god among
many.  But then, as Babylon grew and became the
great centre, Marduk came to be regarded as the great
god of all the country, exactly as had happened with
Osiris in Egypt.  And then, again just as in Egypt,
they began to look on Shamash and on Marduk as two
forms of one and the same great deity.  Thus, it is
wonderful how like each other were the guesses at
truth in the two empires.  Bel-Merodach, as he was
sometimes called (Bel or Baal means Lord), became of
such immense importance that the king was never
considered to be properly appointed as ruler until he
had been received by Merodach at Babylon, in the
god's great temple there.  The Assyrian kings, whose
capital was Nineveh, in the north of Babylonia, when
they had conquered their former masters of Babylon,
still came to Babylon and paid their homage to the
Babylonian god.
</p>

<p>
But, again as in Egypt, there were a number of
other gods besides Marduk, in other places, whose
authority was considered very powerful just in these
places; and there were other heavenly bodies besides
Shamash, the sun, that had worship.  There was Sin,
the moon, and especially there was Ishtar, the planet
Venus, the Ashtaroth that you read of in the Bible.
Ishtar was goddess of the spring and of all the
life-giving forces in Nature.
</p>

<p>
And in Babylonia, as in Egypt, there were immense
numbers of priests, and their power was great.  They
were occupied in the ceremonies to the gods, and in
care of the temples, and a great part of their time was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
taken up in watching the stars and planets.  They saw
that many of the happenings on earth depended on the
heavenly bodies&mdash;the sun made the seed grow in the
damp warm earth; perhaps they knew that the moon
affected the tides.  At all events they saw that certain
events on earth happened at the same time as certain
other events in the heavens; so they grew to think
that the earthly happenings were caused by the changes
of the planets in the sky far more than they are.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Astronomy
</span>
</p>

<p>
But this mistaken idea about the influence of the
stars on the earth had the excellent effect that it
made these old Babylonian priests to be great
star-gazers.  They were great astronomers, and in spite of
their errors made great steps in knowledge.  And
because you can go very little way in astronomy
without mathematics, they became mathematicians
too.  We owe a great deal to what these wise men of the
East, watching the stars so long ago, found out for us.
</p>

<p>
Some of the Babylonians also believed in fearful
demons and powers of evil, and it seems as if they
imagined their gods to take much more notice of their
behaviour, their good and bad conduct, than the
Egyptians' gods were supposed to take.  We saw that the
Egyptian idea was that so long as they performed all the
religious rites exactly, that was all that the gods cared
about.  But the Babylonians thought that their gods
did interest themselves a great deal about the right or
wrong conduct of the men over whom they ruled, and
punished or rewarded them in this life accordingly.
</p>

<p>
And through all this that I am telling you about the
religion of the early Babylonians, I want you to bear
in mind that Abraham, the founder of the Jewish
nation, came from "Ur of the Chaldees," that is,
from the south of Babylonia.  That means that he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
came carrying with him beliefs and customs that he
and his clan (if I may call it so) had learnt in Babylonia.
Telling you these Babylonian beliefs, I am really telling
you the origins of the beliefs which have come down to
us through the Israelites.  That is what makes their
story so particularly interesting for us.
</p>

<p>
The Babylonians, then, had an idea of a deity who
punished their wrong-doing by sending them illnesses
and famine and so on.  The Egyptians had not this
idea nearly so clearly, but they had the idea that the
man who did well in this life would have his reward in
the life after death.  The Babylonians did not have
this idea of the life after death; we find, at least, no
reason to think that they had it.  Abraham, therefore,
came from Ur without this belief in a life after death.
It was only at a far later period&mdash;possibly, though by
no means certainly, as something they learned from the
Egyptians&mdash;that the belief in a future life came to the
Jews and Israelites.
</p>

<p>
But although Abraham brought traditions from Ur,
so soon as we are allowed to know anything about the
beliefs held by him and his people we find them to be
very much more pure and free from superstitions than
the Babylonian ones.  The Babylonian idea of the
creation was that there was at first a great dragon of
prodigious size.  Merodach, the chief of the gods,
identified with the sun, then fought the dragon, killed
him, cut him in two; of one half of his body made the
firmament of heaven, of the other half made the earth.
Then in the heavens, as stars, he set the lesser gods,
with the moon.  The moon ruled the night and regulated
the division of the year into months (moon-eths).
Mona is the old Anglo-Saxon word for moon.
</p>

<p>
This account is inscribed on tablets, and so much is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
readable, but there is much more which has crumbled
away so that it cannot be read.  The account of the
Creation given in Genesis is, of course, free of all this
fantastic account of the fight with the dragon.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Flood
</span>
</p>

<p>
There are other Babylonian tablets which give an
account of the Flood, but here again we find the idea
that it is sent not by one great god, but by several gods,
working together.  Over them all seems to be the
sun-god, here called Shamash, who is in Heaven.  The
flood is so dreadful that it compels the lesser gods
living on the earth to fly to Heaven for refuge.  There
Ishtar (Venus), taking pity on mankind, prays Shamash
to stop the flood, and he consents to do so.  One of
the earth gods had warned a certain man, named
Ut-napistim, that the flood was coming, and advised him
to make a ship to save himself from it.  So Ut-napistim
built the ship, made it water-tight with pitch, put in
it his family, pairs of all the animals, workmen and a
pilot, and so they floated for seven days until the ship
came to ground on a mountain to the east of the Tigris.
Then, apparently after another seven days, Ut-napistim
sent out first a dove, then a swallow, then a raven.  The
first two came back, but the last did not, from which
Ut-napistim concluded that the raven had found dry
ground somewhere.
</p>

<p>
You will see how like this is to the story of Noah and
the Ark in the Bible, and almost certainly it was with
some such tradition as this in their minds that Abraham
and his people came from Ur.
</p>

<p>
It is my purpose, in this story of mankind around
the Mediterranean, to bother you as little as possible
with names, either of persons or of places, and as little
as possible with dates, because the more we have of
them, the more difficult it becomes to remember those
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
that are really important.  For the years very far back
it is impossible to fix the dates at all exactly.  What is
important is to know in what order the great events in
the story happened.
</p>

<p>
The date at which Abraham came out of Ur and
settled in the southern part of what was afterwards
called Judah has been determined by scholars to
have been about 2250 or 2300 B.C.  You will remember
that the date to which we brought down the Egyptian
story was about 1500 B.C.  So Abraham came to
Palestine about 750 years earlier than that.
</p>

<p>
Abraham's date is more or less fixed by the
evidence of what is by far the most famous code of
ancient laws and customs that has come down to us,
far beyond anything of the kind that has been found in
Egypt, the code of Khammurabi.  Khammurabi was
king of Babylon, and it is considered nearly sure that it
is he who is meant by "Amraphel, king of Shinar"
mentioned in Genesis.  He lived at the same time as
Abraham.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Code of Khammurabi
</span>
</p>

<p>
Now, this code, or list, of laws engraved on tablets is
most interesting to us not only because it is ancient,
but also because it is so very modern.  I mean that
although these laws were made so very long ago, they
are laws which we could very nearly accept as suitable
for us to live under to-day.  Our lives would be very
little altered if we were to try to lead them according
to those laws instead of according to the laws under
which we actually do live.
</p>

<p>
If Khammurabi, in 2250 B.C., had these laws
engraven, we may be nearly sure that they were the
laws by which the country was governed many years
before that.  How long before, we cannot tell.  Tablets
on which some of them were recorded were found in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
what has been called the library (though I do not
suppose that there were exactly what we should call
books in it, and the name "library" comes from <i>liber</i>,
a book)&mdash;collected by a certain great king of Assyria,
Assurbanipal or Sardanapalus, by name, who reigned
in Nineveh, which was the capital of Assyria, about
700 B.C. or a little later.  A great many similar records
and tablets collected by this king have been found.
But a far more complete list of the laws was found
later at Susa, a city which was afterwards called
Persepolis.
</p>

<p>
Not only are the laws themselves such as we might
make and use, but they seem to show that there
existed in Babylon at that far-away time a society and
a kind of life not at all unlike ours.  There were doctors,
lawyers and merchants, and the fees of the doctors and
the ways in which the merchants were to carry on their
trade were fixed by the laws.  It is clear that there
were a great many slaves employed&mdash;that is a difference,
of course, from our society.  The punishments for
law-breaking were more severe than ours.  Murder is
the only crime which we now punish with death.  In
Khammurabi's code, burglary and stealing are
punished by death; so is any attempt to induce
witnesses in a case at law to give false witness; and
there are numerous other offences for which death was
the punishment in Babylon, but for which we should
make the offender pay a fine or go to prison for a while.
But we have to remember that it is not so very many
years ago even in this country since a man could be
hanged for forgery or for stealing a sheep.  The laws
of Khammurabi are not more severe than ours were not
much more than a hundred years ago.
</p>

<p>
When there were serfs in England, labourers almost
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
in a state of slavery, English law made a great
distinction between them and freemen.  An offence
against the laws, if committed by a serf, was very much
more heavily punished than the same offence
committed by a freeman.  And we find exactly the same
distinction made in this ancient code; the slave suffers
far more heavily than the freeman.
</p>

<p>
Some of the laws show the importance of the
canals for watering the land, and each owner of land
beside a canal was made responsible for the canal bank
which ran through or beside his property.  If he
let it fall into bad repair, and the water, overflowing,
damaged his neighbour's land or drowned his sheep,
he had to make good the loss caused to his neighbour.
</p>

<p>
The law of "a tooth for a tooth" and "an eye for
an eye" which we find in the Bible, in the book of
Exodus, we find here too.  If you knocked out a
man's eye in a fight, you would have to submit to having
an eye of your own knocked out.  If you knocked out
a tooth, a tooth of yours would be knocked out.
</p>

<p>
Susa, where the full code of Khammurabi was found,
was the capital of the kingdom of a people called
Elamites, of whom you hear in the Bible.  Elam lay
on the eastern, the Persian, side of Babylonia, and the
Elamites gave continual trouble to the Babylonian
conquerors.  The code is cut on a great block of black
stone eight feet high.  It is in forty-four columns
and consists of no less than 3654 lines&mdash;a lengthy
document.  And at the top of it there is cut the
figure of King Khammurabi receiving the tablets of
the law from Shamash, the great sun-god.  It must
remind us of Moses receiving the tablets with the
Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai.
</p>

<p>
There can be little doubt that these laws, more or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
less as they are graven on this stone, were those under
which the greater number of the Semitic tribes lived
which inhabited Syria and Palestine.  Among these
tribes were the Jews.  For this reason we may imagine
that when the Babylonians made attacks upon them
and reduced them, as they did from time to time, to
submission, their own laws and customs were not much
altered.  They had to pay tribute, perhaps, and their
homes were broken up, and some of them, like the
Jews, were taken away into Babylonia, but they went
among a people not altogether different from themselves
either in nationality or in their ways of living.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Art in Babylonia
</span>
</p>

<p>
And just as we are surprised by the advanced state
of civilisation which these old laws show us, so we have
to be no less astonished by the fine works of art which
they made.  Stone, as we have said, was rare in
Babylonia; therefore they looked on it as precious, and
kept it for engraving.  Some of the cut stones of very
early date are finely finished.  In the Louvre in Paris
there is a splendidly worked Babylonian vase with a
hunting scene of lions upon it, and it is thought to have
been made long before the time of this Khammurabi,
whose code we have been speaking of.  There were
lions in this country then, though there are none now.
You may remember many references to lions in the
Bible.
</p>

<p>
We know, then, that the Babylonians had their
artists and their workers in gold.  Probably the gold
came to them either through Egypt or across the Red
Sea from Nubia and Africa farther south; Babylonia
had no gold.  Some, however, may have come from the
East.  They made ornaments of the gold and of the
cut stones, and their costume would seem to have been
like that of the Egyptians, but with more flowing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
skirts.  We have seen that the Egyptians, just about
the time that they began to know more of the
Babylonians, that is a little before 1500 B.C., began to
lengthen their skirts also.  Probably the dresses of the
Babylonians were more rich in ornament than the
Egyptian.  With both, as with the dwellers in all the
warm climates of the world,
there can be little doubt that
the dress was a natural
development from the cloth
round the loins&mdash;the skirts
lengthened downwards and
some species of jacket drawn
on over the upper part of
the body.  Or a long robe
of light material, which
I have likened to a
nightgown, was put on over the
shoulders and hung down to
the ankles, perhaps, so that
it did for both skirt and
jacket in one.  To this it
would be very easy and
natural to add a girdle or
sash, to tie it in round the
waist and prevent its flapping
in too inconvenient a manner.
</p>

ASSYRIAN KING IN HIS ROBES.
</p>

<p>
Once you get the long robe, you come to something
which would need very little change to become the
sort of robe which the Greeks and Romans wore&mdash;what
the Romans called the "toga."  I should
think these long skirts would be very much in the way
when those who wore them wanted to run or make any
swift movement, and I suppose that when we read in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
the Bible of people "girding up their loins," when they
were going on any expedition, it means that they tucked
up these skirts and fastened them round with the
girdle about their waists, so that they should not hang
around their legs.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Rise of Assyria
</span>
</p>

<p>
In order to make this story pleasant and easy
reading, as it ought to be, I have said that I want to
bother you about dates as little as possible, but it is
necessary to take some notice of them.  In the first
place, for the understanding of this particular part of
the great story&mdash;the part that has to do with
Babylonia&mdash;you ought to know that the date at which the
Assyrians, in the northeen section of the country, with
their capital of Nineveh, revolted against the rule of
Babylon, to which we find that they were subject
when the story opens, was about 1900 B.C.  That is to
say, about 400 years before the great period of the
Egyptian power, dating from 1500 B.C., or thereabouts.
Assyria, which at first was subject to Babylon,
revolted and became master of Babylon about 1900
B.C. and retained that mastery, with some ups and downs,
for about 1500 years.  This greatest story in the world
deals with big spaces of time!  Then the Assyrian
power went to pieces and Babylon established itself
again as the master power about the time of that
Nebuchadnezzar of whom the Bible tells us.
</p>

<p>
So we have to realise that when, in 1500 B.C., or
rather sooner, Egypt and Babylonia, according to the
Egyptian records, began to clash against each other
harder than ever before, with the result of squeezing
very uncomfortably those Semitic tribes in Palestine,
it was a Babylonia under the Assyrian domination.
And the Assyrians were a more war-like people than the
Babylonians.  They had a better-ordered and doubtless
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P68"></a>68}</span>
a better-equipped army.  Theirs seems to have been
almost what we should call a military state,
constituted for war, and they called themselves masters of
the whole country north of the Persian Gulf and of
Egypt and of all east of the Mediterranean Sea.
</p>

<p>
In the story of mankind we find it happening again
and again that after a people have been comfortably
settled for a while in the fertile plains and river valleys
they lose the warlike habits by means of which they got
possession of these good lands, and are overthrown by
others coming from a more mountainous and barren
country where they have been obliged to live hardier
lives.  Thus, these Assyrians from the north got the
better of the Babylonians, and the Assyrians in their
turn were constantly being troubled by the attacks of a
people called the Hittites, from farther north again.
</p>

<p>
You read of the Hittites in the Bible.  Not a very
great deal is known about them, but it is certain that
they were a great power in all that country lying north
and north-west of Assyria which is now called Asia
Minor.  They made incursions and attacks down
south, and it is probable that after their great attacks
were repulsed they left some of their tribes in the south,
separated from the rest of the nation.  In the latter
part of our story it is these scattered tribes that we
hear most about.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Cuneiform writing
</span>
</p>

<p>
Now, the earliest of the inscriptions which tell us
anything about these people of Babylonia goes back to
the time before the Semites had come up from Arabia
in the south.  Edim, or the plain of Babylonia, from
which we may suppose that the name Eden, in Genesis,
came, was probably then inhabited by those Sumerians
of whom we know very little.  We know little, but we
find inscriptions by them, and the inscriptions are in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P69"></a>69}</span>
a very curious form of writing, a writing which went on
being used for thousands of years.  It is called
cuneiform, from "cuneus," meaning a wedge, because
all the lines of the writing are inclined to go into the
shape of a wedge.
</p>

<p>
You will remember something about the Egyptian
hieroglyphic and picture writing.  Probably all writing
began in this way, with making pictures.  Then
it was found troublesome to make a picture of
everything that you wanted to say, and a few dashes
or lines, very roughly representing the thing, were
used instead, and began to be understood as standing
for a sign of that thing.
</p>

<p>
This wedge writing of the Babylonians doubtless
began in this way.  I say doubtless, because some of it
is almost picture-writing, and the older the inscriptions
the more like actual pictures of the thing as we see it
the signs are.  Thus, the sign which they made to
mean heaven was something like this *, which we call
an asterisk, from "aster," meaning a star.  They
made a drawing like a star to give the idea of heaven,
because heaven is the place where the stars are.  The
rays, as we call them, of the star, were more wedge-shaped
than the lines of our asterisk, but that is a small
difference.  It is said that when the "stilus," which is
the tool they used for making the inscriptions, is used
to make the mark of a line on wet clay, the shape into
which that mark would naturally go is that of a wedge;
they had much clay for their bricks, and very likely
that is why we see this writing in the form that it
has.
</p>

<p>
You may remember how we cited, as an instance
of the way in which the Egyptians developed their
writing, that we had first the picture of an eye, and then
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
the picture of a bird, and, putting the eye before the
bird, we got the idea "I see a bird."  Now, in much
the same way, in the wedge-writing we find that an
arrangement of three upright wedges is taken as the
sign which means "water."  There is an arrangement
of a good many wedges which is the sign that means
"mouth," and this arrangement is in such a shape
that it must make us think that it came from an
original drawing of a mouth.  So, having this sign for
water and this other sign for a mouth, what these
cuneiform writers did when they wanted to make a
sign which should mean "drinking" was to put the
sign for water inside the sign for mouth.  A good idea!
</p>

<p>
But all this writing, so far, proceeded on the plan of
making signs to represent things that you saw or the
ideas that came from what you saw.  And then, I
imagine, it occurred to some inventive genius to say,
"Suppose, instead of making these signs to represent
things that we see, that we make them represent
sounds&mdash;make them stand for the names that we call
them by?  Now, suppose we take the word 'dog':
(only he, of course, would make use of the Babylonian
sound, whatever it was, which they used for 'dog').
"Suppose we take the word 'dog,'" he said, "and
suppose we take one of our signs, which we use to
represent things, and let it stand for the first sound
that we make in saying the word.  Suppose that we
take another sign to stand for the second sound, the
middle sound, in the word, and a third sign to stand
for the last sound."
</p>

<p>
"Well," the people to whom he suggested the idea
might say, "you do not seem to gain much by that.
It would be much simpler and easier to go on making
the sign for a dog, as we always have done."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P71"></a>71}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he might answer, "that is quite true, so far
as writing about a dog, and a dog only, is concerned,
but the advantage that I claim for my idea is that
these signs, which I say we might use to stand for the
sound that we make when we say 'dog,' may be used
over and over again, whenever we have to make those
sounds.  And we do not make a very large number of
different sounds&mdash;not nearly so many as there are
ideas and objects that we wish to write about.  So,
on my plan, we shall not need nearly so many signs as
we have been using."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The alphabet
</span>
</p>

<p>
I take it that it was thus, or in some way rather like
this, that what we call writing (that is to say, making
signs on paper or some other substance to represent
the sounds by which we call things), came to take the
place of the more primitive way of sending messages,
or of making records, which was by drawing pictures
of them.  We, as you know, have twenty-six signs,
twenty-six letters, in what we call our
alphabet&mdash;twenty-six signs for the sounds that we make in
speaking.  The alphabet is called so from the first two
letters "alpha" and "beta," corresponding to our
"a" and "b," in the Greek alphabet.  Different
alphabets have different numbers of letters, standing
for different sounds.  In our own alphabet we know
that the same letter, that is to say the same sign, may
stand for different sounds.  Take the very first letter
"a," and take the words "father," "paper," and
"many"; there you have three quite different sounds
for each of which the one sign "a" does the work.
An alphabet with signs enough to include all the sounds
we make in talking would be terribly long.
</p>

<p>
The cuneiform writing was in use up to within
100 years of the birth of Christ, and its use extended
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
from very far up in the north of Asia Minor to
the Persian Gulf and away south-westward of the Red
Sea in Upper Egypt.  It is there found on some very
important tablets of just about that greatest date in
all Egyptian history, 1500.  And it was in use for
trading and correspondence from Elam on the eastern
boundary of Babylonia, right to the Mediterranean
Sea.
</p>

<p>
Thus it was of far more general use in those old
days than the picture-writing of the Egyptians.
Probably it was far more convenient.  Then, in its turn,
it fell out of use because of the invention of a mode of
writing more convenient still, and not unlike
ours&mdash;from which, indeed, ours is taken.  But that is
"another story," as Rudyard Kipling says.
</p>

<p>
Let us just take a look now and see what Abraham
and his descendants were doing in this interval between
their coming up from Ur, which was in the land of the
Chaldee, in the south of Babylonia, and the year
1500 B.C.  The story will not be long in the telling,
because we know so little about it.
</p>

<p>
What we do know is that they lived for many many
years in the southern part of the country which, later
on, was called Judah.  We may imagine that they
increased and multiplied, till they became a large and
formidable tribe.  It is thought that they stayed in this
Southern Judah, leading a pastoral life, with sheep and
cattle, for some 600 years.  And then there came upon
them a time of famine, when there was no food for
their sheep or oxen and very little for themselves.
But they lived right on the great road by which the
traders and merchants travelled when they went from
Egypt into Babylonia, or <i>vice versâ</i>, and it was told to
them that "there is corn in Egypt."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
</p>

<p>
You will remember that, about the corn in Egypt,
from the story of Joseph and his brethren, as told in
the Bible.  And the end of that story, as you know, is
that the whole tribe&mdash;all the children of Israel, as the
Bible says&mdash;moved down into that "land of Goshen"
which was in the north-east of Egypt.  It was a
country of rich land, lying low.
</p>

<p>
Now, what are we to suppose was the reason that
the Egyptians allowed these foreigners to come down,
as they did, and settle on this land over which they
claimed to rule?  We may answer that question in
this way.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Shepherd Kings
</span>
</p>

<p>
If the Israelites, as we now may call them&mdash;the
tribe of which Jacob, who was also called Israel, was
the head&mdash;were in the south of Judah for 600 years,
between the time that they came from Chaldæa
and the time that they went into the land of
Goshen, it must have been in somewhere about the
year 1700 B.C. that they made this later journey.  That
is 200 years before the rule of the famous eighteenth
dynasty.  And in 1700 B.C. the dynasty then ruling
in Egypt was the so-called Hyksos dynasty.  It was
also called the dynasty of the Shepherd Kings.  The
Egyptians, as we have seen, had become weakened as
a nation.  They were constantly quarrelling among
themselves, rather as the old English barons used to
quarrel among themselves or against the king.  The
result was that foreign invaders came in from time to
time, in the course of the story, and took the kingship
for a while, excluding all the native Egyptian great
men from the throne.
</p>

<p>
These Hyksos, who had the rule in Egypt when the
Israelites were welcomed there, were invaders of this
kind, foreigners who had seized the throne and the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P74"></a>74}</span>
power.  They were shepherds, living the pastoral
life&mdash;though perhaps they left off that when they became the
rulers of Egypt&mdash;and wherever they came from, whether
direct from Arabia or, as is more likely, from farther
north, probably from Syria, all scholars are, I think,
agreed that they were Semites.  Josephus, the historian
of the Jews, asserts that they actually were the
Israelites.  Modern historians think him mistaken there.
But, though not Israelites, they were almost certainly
of the same Arabian origin.
</p>

<p>
And there you have the answer to the question
how it came about that the Israelites found a welcome
in Egypt.  The powerful people in the country were
their relations.
</p>

<p>
And so things went well with them for many years,
perhaps about three or four hundred; but other
powers&mdash;"a Pharaoh that knew not Joseph"&mdash;at
length threw off the yoke of the Hyksos, the Shepherds,
and took the throne from them.  The Israelites were
shown no favour then.  They were set hard tasks,
were treated like slaves, until finally, under the
leadership of a very great man and prophet, Moses, they
decided to flee away into the desert, away from the land
of Goshen, in which they were made so unhappy,
although it was a fertile land.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
After the Exodus
</span>
</p>

<p>
Probably they were very useful slaves and tillers
of the soil, and probably that was the reason why, as
we are told in the Bible, Pharaoh was so unwilling to
let them go.  At length, however, go they did&mdash;only,
as we are further told, to be pursued, and only, as the
Bible also tells us, to be saved by a miracle at the
passage of the Red Sea.
</p>

<p>
This Exodus, as it is called, probably took place in
1200 B.C. or a little earlier, and the Israelites wandered
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
some forty years in the wilderness, living in tents, and
moving about as the manner of pastoral tribes was,
and is, with their flocks and herds.  We see, then, that
1150 B.C. or a few years sooner, would be about the
date at which they would begin, under Joshua, the
invasion of Canaan.  Our story has not reached that
point yet.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
THE MINOANS IN CRETE
</h3>

<p>
Those, then, were the two great powers on land in the
very old days of the story of mankind.  There was
Egypt along the Nile, and Babylonia&mdash;for a thousand
and more years, rather to be called Assyria&mdash;along the
Euphrates and Tigris.
</p>

<p>
But there was also yet a third power, very great,
very ancient, and highly civilised, a sea-power, with its
capital in the big island, which you will sec on the map,
lying to the south of Greece, Crete.
</p>

<p>
You will observe, perhaps, that it quite agrees with
all that we find in the later story of mankind, that a
nation living on an island should be powerful at sea.
To-day you see the great sea-powers, ourselves and
Japan.  We live on islands that are small when
compared with the lands of Germany, France, America,
Russia, China; but we have more power in ships and
seamen.  Perhaps America is going to have a greater
power than Japan, but at the time that I am writing
she has not.
</p>

<p>
It is only of rather recent years that we have come
to know much about this very ancient Cretan civilisation,
and chiefly it is owing to the work of a great
antiquary, Sir Arthur Evans, that we have discovered
the story.  It must be very interesting to be an
antiquary and to dig&mdash;or to order a gang of diggers to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P77"></a>77}</span>
dig under your directions&mdash;and not to know what you
may be going to turn up next: now a gold ear-ring,
now a bronze sword, now the edge of a worked stone
that may be the corner-stone of a building which
more digging may prove to be one of the greatest and
most marvellous buildings in the world!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Knossos
</span>
</p>

<p>
It sounds like a fairy story; but it was a fairy
story which Sir Arthur Evans made come true at a
place in Crete where the ancient city of Knossos used
to be.  He found wonderful things&mdash;an immense
palace, a place which inscriptions, also there discovered,
show to have been a temple of the gods as well.  The
king, it is evident, was high-priest as well as king:
we have seen that union of the two offices, the king's
and the priest's, before, both in Egypt and in Babylonia.
(When I say before, I mean that I wrote of it earlier
in the story.  I do not mean that it came any earlier
in the time of its actual happening.) There is evidence
to show that the Cretan people were civilised, could
make fine works of art and so on, right back to the very
earliest date at which the evidences from the peoples
living along the river-courses have anything to show
us.  Maybe the Cretans acquired their civilisation
even earlier than the others.
</p>

<p>
We cannot be sure of that.  What we can be sure
of is that an enormous number of years ago they were
marvellous engineers and architects, as well as workers
of ornaments, and of fine pottery and glazed ware.
The palace at Knossos is an immense place, with great
columns, walls, halls.  We wonder as much at the splendid
imagination of the architect who could plan buildings
on such a grand scale so very long ago as we do at the
engineer's power to work and lift into position such
huge stones as we find were used in the building.  And
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
the delicacy of the finish is wonderful too.  It is not
only the vastness of the size that amazes us.  That is
the chief wonder of the Egyptian pyramids.  But the
buildings and other remains in Crete are more wonderful
still.
</p>

<p>
This Cretan civilisation at so very early a date
makes an extraordinary chapter in the world's
story.  It would still have been a story very
extraordinary if it had been only just the story of what
happened in the island of Crete, and did not spread
beyond it.  But, as a matter of fact, it did spread very
far beyond that island.  It spread out north, east,
south, and west&mdash;up into Greece, across to Syria,
down to Egypt, and away to Sicily.
</p>

<p>
In your books you are likely to read about all this
as "the Minoan civilisation."  Probably there really
was some great king of old in Crete whose name was
Minos.  It is possible that there were many of the
name, and that all the kings of his dynasty were called
Minos, with some other name besides to distinguish
them.  However that may be, the Cretan legendary
story was that Minos was a very great king, half
divine, who gave laws and the arts of civilisation to his
people, rather as Khammurabi was supposed to have
given laws to the Babylonians.  And, again like
Khammurabi, Minos was supposed to have received
these laws from a deity, the greatest deity that the
Minoans, as they were called, knew.  But this deity
of theirs was supposed to be female, a goddess, the
goddess Ishtar of the Babylonians&mdash;the Ashtaroth of
the Bible.  The Cretans, however, made her the chief
of all the gods.  The Babylonians held her in second
place, as spouse of the chief god Shamash, the sun-god.
</p>

<p>
These splendid buildings of the Minoans, as they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P79"></a>79}</span>
have been discovered for us by the digger, have a much
more modern, a much less strange, appearance than
those either of Babylonia or of Egypt.  The Babylonian
buildings especially look to us, as we make
pictures of them in our minds, like palaces of some
great ogre.  The supports at each side of the doors and
gates are very often in the form of huge winged bulls.
Human heads and figures of colossal size are to be
seen everywhere.  And the human heads have generally
great beards, and perhaps the rest of the hair worked
up into a square pattern, with curls, so that they look
horrible.  All the insides of the Babylonian palaces
seem to have been adorned with enormous hunting
scenes, worked in a kind of gypsum which was found
in the country.  I think we should feel terribly afraid
if we suddenly found ourselves in an ancient Babylonian
palace or even an Egyptian one.
</p>

<p>
But I believe that we should feel very much happier
and more at home if we could be transported suddenly
into one of the old Minoan palaces.  And I believe
that I can make a guess why that is so.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Cretan architecture
</span>
</p>

<p>
The Babylonian and the Egyptian style of building
was found in these two countries, but neither
Babylonians nor Egyptians went much across the sea&mdash;the
Mediterranean Sea.  But these Cretans, as I have
said, were great sea-goers.  They were the great naval
power in the Mediterranean.  So they went, and
carried with them their ideas and their ways of building,
everywhere.  The effect of that is seen most of all
perhaps at the site of an old Greek city on the mainland
of Greece, Mycenæ, where great excavations have
been made.  But the effect is found in many other
places too.  So it has come down through the Greeks
and through the Romans, and has been in the minds
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
and in the eyes of later builders, although the builders
were generally, as we may suppose, not at all aware
that they owed anything to these builders of so many
thousands of years ago.
</p>

<p>
It is a curious thing that in Egypt, in Babylonia,
and also in Crete, some of the very oldest buildings
and some of the very oldest works of art are the best.
We have a comfortable idea in our minds that we&mdash;that
is to say, mankind&mdash;have been making progress, have
been improving, all through the story; but
unfortunately there are some things in which we do not
seem to have improved&mdash;some kinds of work in which
the oldest is the best.
</p>

<p>
And as I have said that the ancient buildings found
in Crete are of a style that does not look nearly so
strange to us as the ancient buildings of the countries
on the mainland, so the Minoan engravings show us the
people of that very far-off time dressed in a fashion that
seems almost familiar to us.  They do not look nearly so
strange as the people that we see pictured and graven on
the walls of those other palaces and tombs and temples.
</p>

<p>
We find many evidences, and evidences of many
different kinds, of the sea-faring habits of the ancient
Cretans, and of their great power.  We find Minoan
works of art in the tombs of Egyptian kings, and
Egyptian ornaments in the Minoan palaces.  We find,
as I have said, the Minoan bronze work as far to the
west as Sicily.  Athens, the great Athens of Greece,
seems to have been subject to the Minoans and to have
paid tribute to them.  And a very cruel form some of
that tribute took.  According to the old historians,
they had to send seven maidens and seven youths each
year to Crete; and we seem to be able to guess the
purpose for which they were sent.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
</p>

<p>
The legend is that they had to be sent each year to
be devoured by, or be sacrificed to, a Cretan monster
called the Minotaur.  The name Minotaur is from
Minos and tauros, meaning a bull.  It was figured as
a half human, half bull-like monster.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Labyrinth
</span>
</p>

<p>
One of the most famous of the buildings discovered
by the diggers in Crete is the Labyrinth, a building of
an immense number of passages in which you were
almost certain to lose your way if you did not know it.
You would be lost, and never come back, and the
Minotaur was supposed to live in this Labyrinth, and
you would wander about there till he
came upon you and killed you.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-081"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-081.jpg" alt="COIN OF KNOSSOS (SHOWING LABYRINTH).">
<br>
COIN OF KNOSSOS (SHOWING LABYRINTH).
</p>

<p>
This legend of the Minotaur and
the Labyrinth is particularly worth
attending to because it shows us so
well how the unreal stories grew up
out of the real, and how we are
sometimes able to find out the real truth
under the unreal story.
</p>

<p>
There was this real Labyrinth in Crete; and this
tribute of seven maids and seven youths was, we may
be tolerably sure, demanded of the Athenians.  One or
more of the drawings on the Minoan palace walls show
bull-fights going on, and in the bull-ring are not only
men, but also maidens, fighting the bull.  One does
not know whether all the Athenian maidens and youths
were intended for this bull-fighting, but it is exceedingly
likely that many of them were condemned to it, just as
prisoners of war and others were made to fight lions in
the amphitheatre at Rome.  And out of this fact, of
the maidens and youths in the bull-ring, might very
easily grow the story of the Minotaur&mdash;the bull-monster
of Minos&mdash;and his victim.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
</p>

<p>
How Theseus slew the Minotaur and found his way
out of the Labyrinth by a clue given him by Ariadne, the
king's daughter, who had fallen in love with him, is all
a further fancy that grew up out of the solid facts of
the Labyrinth and the bull-fighting.
</p>

<p>
It is very wonderful that these ancient people
should have been able to make their power felt so far
from their home island, because of the difficulty in
crossing the open seas.  Their ships were propelled by
the oars of rowers and by the wind in the sails when the
wind was in their favour&mdash;that is to say, was blowing in
the direction in which they wanted to go.  The sails of
modern sailing vessels are so arranged that our ships
can sail up into the wind, as it is called.  They can go
in a direction at right angles to the direction of the wind
very easily, and even when it is a little opposed to them,
by means of setting the sails so as to catch the wind
side-ways.  But there is no evidence that the Minoans
were able to do this, and we know that in far later
days of our story no such device was used.  They had
a squarish-shaped sail attached to the mast, more like
our lug-sail than any other kind of rigging that is used
now.  And yet, with these poor appliances, they went
to Egypt, to Syria, and to Sicily, and no doubt farther
west again.  And they went in numbers, for otherwise
they would not have been able to subjugate the native
people as we know that they did at Athens.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The pirates
</span>
</p>

<p>
We may suppose that they went for a double
purpose&mdash;for trade and also for piracy, to take forcible
possession of what they wanted wherever they found
it.  In those days, and for a long time afterwards, it
does not seem as if they had any idea that it was
contrary to what was right and just to take anything that
they were able to take from another nation.  Any
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
idea of what we call international justice was very
little thought of, if thought of at all.  They could, and
they did, make laws among themselves which surprise
us by their justice, but these laws were for each nation
itself.  We have seen the idea of a single god, supreme
over a whole nation, held at times by them, but even
that did not mean that they had an idea of a single god
supreme over the whole of the world.  He was a
national god only, and if the idea of the divine law was
thus national only, it was not likely that they would
have the idea that any laws made by man were to be
obeyed beyond the limits of the nation by which they
were made.
</p>

<p>
So we may be sure that these ancient Minoans were
what we should call pirates.  They swept the sea in
their ships attacking and capturing the ships of other
peoples wherever they found them, and landing and
making forays on the mainland much as the Vikings of
Norway did around our own shores at a far later date.
And this state of things in the Mediterranean is worth
particular attention because these pirates, of one
nation or another, will be found actively at work all
through the pages of this great story of mankind.
The Mediterranean was not freed from them until a
very recent date.
</p>

<p>
Now, that piracy, together with the style of
architecture and the making of smaller works of art
which they practised, are the two great facts to
remember about this wonderful civilisation of the
ancient Minoans.  For just about the year 1500 B.C.,
at which we left the story of Egypt, or a little later,
some terrible catastrophe overtook the Minoans.
What happened we do not know.  It has been guessed
that they suffered an invasion and a complete overthrow
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P84"></a>84}</span>
by the Dorians, a people who had come down
from the north and had taken possession of that
southern part of Greece which is called the Peloponnese.
But nothing is certainly known, except that the
Minoans did suffer a very complete overthrow, that
their power was shattered, their splendid buildings
were destroyed, and they seem to vanish out of the
story altogether.  Their conquerors were evidently a
people far less civilised and accomplished than they.
Antiquaries tell us that there were at least two
distinct stages in the making of buildings and works of
art under the Minoans before this last catastrophe, but
after that there is no building, no art work, worth
accounting for.  It all went.
</p>

<p>
But they had left the mark of their genius in the
buildings at Mycenæ and elsewhere, and they had
established the habit of piracy in the seas about their
island.
</p>

<p>
So now, I think, we have the frame set in which
we may place the picture.  We have these ancient
Egyptians leading the kind of life that I have tried to
show you.  We have the Babylonians and Assyrians
along those other river-courses established as a great
power in the east, and we have the Minoans, very
shortly to be overthrown and to disappear, scouring
the seas in their ships and having all the power along
the coasts.  And between them, in the very midst, is
that country of Syria and Palestine which&mdash;especially
Palestine, because it is south of Syria&mdash;lies right in the
course which the great empires must traverse when
they come to grips with each other.  Palestine is the
country through which they must pass whether for
trade or for war with each other.  You can imagine
what a terrible position that must have been.  Syria
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
and Palestine, as you know, were peopled by Semitic
tribes, to which race the Babylonians also belonged
originally.  But the divisions and differences, both
between the Babylonians and the others, and between
these others, among themselves, were many and of
various kinds.  Some must have regarded each other
as almost of the same kindred.  Others must have
seemed quite strange and foreign.  It was a great mixture.
</p>

<p>
And for the moment, in or about 1500 B.C., the
Israelites as a nation are not in Palestine at all.  They
are in the land of Goshen, undergoing that oppression
of which you know.  Within 300 years or so they
will make their Exodus and begin their forty
years of wandering in the wilderness, to re-appear in
the story, under the leadership of Joshua; conquering
the Canaanites and so establishing themselves right in
the most dangerous position of all, in Palestine, on
the highway between the two great empires.

<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
THE MEETING OF THE EMPIRES
</h3>

<p>
It rather looks as if the casting out of the Hyksos, the
foreign "shepherd kings," made the Egyptians realise
that they must combine and unite and not go on fighting
among themselves, if they meant to be strong enough
to resist the attacks of their neighbours.  Whether
that was the reason or not, the records seem to show
that just at this time there began to be far less fighting
between the big landowners; and the king, Pharaoh,
began to have more power in his own hands, and to be
able to give effect to his will, by means of his vizier or
prime minister, and the rest of his officers over all the
country.
</p>

<p>
Thus more strong by being united, the Egyptians
drove out the Hyksos.  They also took forcible
measures against the African tribes that were pressing
them on the south, and established their power right
up to the fourth cataract on the Nile, a long way
farther south than the boundary of the more ancient
empire.  Against Nubia, farther south again, and
against Libya, on their west, they fought effectively,
and thus we may suppose that they made themselves
more safe than they ever had been before from invasion
by these African peoples.
</p>

<p>
There were two great kings of the name of Thothmes
or Tethmosis, of this eighteenth dynasty, under whom
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P87"></a>87}</span>
most of these big achievements were done&mdash;Thothmes
I. and Thothmes III.  The second Thothmes reigned for
a year or two only.  Thothmes I. led the Egyptian
armies up through Palestine, overcame Syria, and went
as a conqueror as far east as the Euphrates, where
he set up a column, with an account of it all, to
commemorate his victories.
</p>

<p>
But Thothmes III. was a more splendid Pharaoh
still, and under him Egypt came to the height of its
military power.  Syria had revolted; so he marched
north and utterly defeated the Syrians at Megiddo.
Then he turned east and fought his way across the
Euphrates, where he set up a column to his own glory
beside that of Thothmes I.  It is recorded of him that
he had presents given him by the king of Babylon, and
even by the king of the Hittites&mdash;that people from the
north who had established themselves in Asia Minor
and who were constantly giving trouble down in
Syria.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Elamites
</span>
</p>

<p>
And as for Babylon itself, there can be little doubt
that at this time it was in the midst of troubles.  It was
pressed upon thus, as we see, by the growing power of
Egypt on the west.  Then on the eastern side it was
continually being troubled by that powerful nation,
the Elamites, whose capital was Susa.  I do not want
to bother you much about these Elamites, though their
power was great and their civilisation an old
civilisation.  They were important enough to Babylon,
because they were constantly giving trouble, very much
as the stronger African tribes gave trouble to the
Egyptians.  But apart from this they do not occupy
any very big part in the great story.  They were not
exactly what we should call world-makers, and it is
only the world-makers that we are taking as the actors
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P88"></a>88}</span>
in our story.  They came rather near being world-makers
in the great sense, for there was a moment when
they seriously threatened to subjugate Babylonia, but
the Babylonians just succeeded in defeating them.
</p>

<p>
And then, of course, there were the Assyrians in the
north, already quite independent in reality, though
Babylon still claimed a suzerainty over them.
</p>

<p>
So now continually, for hundreds of years, the
story goes on repeating itself in the same way over and
over again.  The Assyrians begin to get more and more
power in the east and they are constantly coming into
conflict with the Egyptians who are constantly fighting
to retain their hold on that Syria which the wars of the
two Thothmes had made an Egyptian province.  Syria
lies north of Palestine: and Palestine, being nearer
to Egypt, was still more insistently claimed by the
Egyptians as theirs.  You may realise how difficult
the position was for these Semitic tribes in Syria and
Palestine, between the two empires.  The tribes were
not united among themselves, so that we can easily
imagine (and we know that it actually did so happen)
that they tried to save themselves by making alliances
with, or admitting themselves as subject to, now one of
the big empires and now the other.  That is the way the
story went for hundreds of years there.  The Children
of Israel, as you know, were not in the Palestine
story at the moment.  It was about 1500 B.C. that
the very great Pharaoh Thothmes III. came to the
throne, at the time when the Israelites were in the land
of Goshen.  It was not until two or three hundred
years later that Moses led them (in Exodus) into
the wilderness.
</p>

<p>
Let us give the date of 1250 B.C. to the Exodus.
It will then be about the year 1200, or a little before,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P89"></a>89}</span>
that the Israelites must have made their way,
conquering, across Jordan and into the land of Canaan.
</p>

<p>
Now, how did it happen that a people thus still
called the Children of Israel could have become so
numerous and so powerful as to be able to win these
victories?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The promised land
</span>
</p>

<p>
In answer to the first question we may say that it
was very many years since the coming of Abraham
from Chaldæa&mdash;more than a thousand years.  That
gives time for a very large increase in numbers.  Then
those years of desert wandering might very likely
have made them hardy.  They had, too, as we know,
deep faith in their "god of battles"&mdash;the Jehovah&mdash;and
in the divine promise that they should win this
land.  And, finally, just at the moment when they
came up out of the desert and began their campaign
against the peoples of Canaan the great empires
happened, as it seems, to have become rather exhausted
by their continual strife together, and the tribes of
Palestine themselves had been so crushed between the
two that perhaps they had not much power of resistance
left.
</p>

<p>
And since there was all this perpetual fighting, it
is interesting to see in what manner and with what
weapons the fighters fought.  The inscriptions tell us
a great deal about them.
</p>

<p>
The people from the east seem to have learnt the
use and value of horses in battle earlier than the
Egyptians, and fighting from chariots seems to have
been an earlier custom than fighting on horseback.
It is said that there are no pictures or carvings of an
earlier date than the Hyksos showing any of the
Egyptians riding on horses, but in the eighteenth
dynasty they had their cavalry&mdash;that is to say, their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
mounted soldiers on horseback&mdash;as well as their fighters
in chariots.  The chariots were not very elaborate.
They were two-wheeled.  The boarding came up
fairly high in front, to the height of a man's elbows or
thereabouts as he stood upright, but sloped away at
the sides towards the back; and the back was often
quite open.  We see a pair of horses or even three
abreast in some of the gravings of the chariots.
</p>

<p>
The men in them, as I say, stood upright.  Often
there were two, of whom one was for the driving and
the other for the shooting, which was nearly always
with the bow and arrow.  I suppose we may say that
the bow and arrow was their great weapon.  Slings
were used, as you will know from the story of David
and Goliath, but the disadvantage of the sling, as
compared with the bow and arrow, except for skirmishing
troops, is quite obvious.  The slinging requires
the twirling of the sling, with the stone in it, round
the head, before the stone can be sent frying out; it
requires plenty of room, or else, in the twirling, you
may easily break the next man's head!  So it is only
of value to troops in "open formation," that is, with
spacious room between one man and the next.  It
does not do for close formation.  The bow and arrow
is a far more convenient weapon for this kind of
fighting.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Weapons and armour
</span>
</p>

<p>
I have said that we often see gravings of one man
driving the horses&mdash;the charioteer&mdash;and of the other
using the bow.  We also sometimes see that, in
horseback fighting, one man, riding on one horse, would
lead and control another horse, on which would be
riding a man who would then have both his hands and
all his attention free for shooting with his bow and
arrow.  That is not always, nor perhaps most often,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
what we find.  The more usual way was for the rider
to control the horse with his own hand on the reins as
best he could while he shot his arrows as he had
opportunity and time.  And they were fine riders,
turning round in the saddle&mdash;if they had a saddle;
but often they are shown riding bareback, and never,
till much later, with stirrups&mdash;and shooting backwards,
over the horse's tail, as he gallops away.
</p>

<p>
The battle-axe was a very common weapon; and
a short sword and a club, sometimes with a stone fixed
in its head to give weight to the blow, are also shown.
The long spear appears to have come into common use
only gradually, and is not seen in the earliest pictures
of the fighting, though we do see short spears, for
throwing.
</p>

<p>
It was not at all uncommon for the fighter on foot
to have a man with him who carried a large shield,
which covered them both.  I imagine that an arrangement
of that kind is meant when we read, as we do in
the Bible, of the "shield-bearer."  For a man to carry
a shield of such size as this with any ease, it had to
be a light shield, and we know that the shields were
commonly made of osier, like our baskets, and covered
with the skins of oxen or other beasts.
</p>

<p>
In the earliest times they seem to have worn very
little armour, to protect them from arrow or sword
strokes, on the body; but helmets, at first soft and
padded, but later of metal, to defend the head, were in
early use, and they were usually made with a peak at the
top and sloping sides which would make a blow glance
off them.  Bronze, as we have seen, was the metal
which they first learnt to work, but as they learnt to
make weapons of iron, which was harder and could be
worked to a sharper edge, bronze went out of use.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P92"></a>92}</span>
</p>

<p>
By the time of the eighteenth Egyptian dynasty,
when the great empires began to meet in serious
fighting, it is likely that both knew something about
the arrangement of their armies into separate bodies
of infantry and cavalry, and of the one supporting and
helping the other in somewhat like the modern manner.
</p>

<p>
This, then, would have been their way of fighting
when they met in the open field.  It was a different
matter when they came to the assault of great cities,
especially such as Babylon and Nineveh, which were
surrounded and protected, as we know, by walls of vast
height and thickness.  The walls of Nineveh, for
instance, were so broad, even on the top, that three
chariots could be driven along them, one beside the
other, and of course the width at the bottom must
have been very much larger.  They had the material
very ready at hand for the making of these immense
walls&mdash;in Babylonia and Assyria at all events.  They
had abundance of clay, and for the greater part of the
walls they used the sun-dried bricks.  But for the lower
parts, which had to bear the weight, they probably
used harder bricks, burnt in the kilns, for there are
engravings of soldiers with some kind of battering-ram
hammering at the bricks from the lower part of the wall
of a city which they are attacking.  The diggers would
be protected, by a shield held over their heads, from
the missiles sent down from the wall above.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Against a walled city
</span>
</p>

<p>
Then they had ladders for the scaling of these
walls when they made the attack.  But of course the
attackers down below would be at a great disadvantage
compared with the defenders on top of the wall.  They
would have a much better chance if by any means
they could hoist themselves up to something like the
same height as the defenders.  And this they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
contrived to do by making movable towers of wood, on
wheels, which could be pushed along by men who were
more or less protected by the towers themselves from
the people shooting at them from the top of the wall.
On the towers would be bowmen who would shoot at
the men on the wall, the shooters in the tower being
protected by the walls, except in so far as they had to
show themselves in order to shoot their arrows or throw
their short spears.
</p>

<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-093.jpg" alt="A BATTERING-RAM.">

A BATTERING-RAM.
</p>

<p>
Another way that they had of hoisting themselves
to the same height as the defenders was to build a
mound outside the walls.  I suppose the earth, as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P94"></a>94}</span>
they threw it up, would protect the builders against
the arrows shot from the wall.  And then, when they
had raised the mound high enough, they would sometimes
wheel their towers to the top of this, and so it
may be that, from the towers on top of the mound,
they may actually have had an advantage in height
over the defenders on the walls.  That would give the
opportunity for their own fellow-soldiers below to set
up the ladders and attempt the scaling of the walls.
</p>

<p>
In that way, or in some ways like that, they attacked
the walled cities.  You may have read words in the
Bible that puzzled you about "bringing a tower"
against a city, or "casting up a bank" against it, or
some such words, and you may now know what they
mean.  They mean the making of these movable
towers for the attack, and throwing up the mounds to
bring the attackers to the same height as the defenders.
It must have been a much more exciting kind of
warfare than the pounding away with artillery at long
range of many miles, as is done in war now.  It was
more like the modern trench war, with bombs and
hand-grenades, when the trenches are close up to one
another.
</p>

<p>
That is a kind of general picture of the way in which
you may imagine these people making war on each
other, constantly making war, in Mesopotamia and in
Syria and in Palestine, for hundreds and hundreds of
years.  And I would remind you yet again that, except
when the Egyptians were taking a hand in it, it was
warfare among nations that were nearly all of the same
original stock or race.  The Hittites, from the north,
were a different people; but most of them had very
much the same ideas and the same ways of life; probably
they could understand each other's language, so that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P95"></a>95}</span>
really when the war had passed over them for the
time being the people who were left in the country,
looking after their flocks and their herds and their
crops, would not see much difference between living
under one power or under another.  Probably it made
very little change in their lives.  And that may explain,
what otherwise seems almost impossible to understand,
how they could survive, how they could go on living at
all, in the midst of this perpetual fighting.
</p>

<p>
We know that the conquerors showed very little
mercy.  Women and children were massacred or carried
off into captivity, to be kept as slaves.  But after
all that dreadful misery had passed over the land the
remnant that remained would go on much as before.
Nothing in the whole story is much more wonderful
than the way in which the Syrians, for instance,
revolted again, very soon after being conquered and
subjugated by the first Thothmes; and the endurance
of the Jews under the repeated conquest of their
country is one of the marvels of history.  It is difficult
to understand how it was that they were not entirely
destroyed as a nation, and that they are among us,
and in every country of the world, as people of a
very distinct character and nationality to-day.  This
tenacity and endurance of the Jews has had a very
great effect in making the world such as it is now that
we are living in it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Philistines
</span>
</p>

<p>
One of the reasons why the Children of Israel under
Joshua were able to get a hold on the land of Canaan is
that the Philistines had already made their appearance
there.  The country of these Philistines was a narrow
stretch along the south-eastern edge of the
Mediterranean, running down to the border of Egypt.  It
seems surprising that the Israelites should owe any
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P96"></a>96}</span>
good thing to the Philistines, because we always find
the two peoples at bitter war with each other; but it
appears that just before the time of the Israelites'
coming up from the southern deserts the Philistines
had been making matters very difficult for the
Egyptians in what the Egyptians called their province
of Palestine, and that this province and the province
of Syria also, a little to the north, were not really under
any effective Egyptian rule at all at the moment.
The tribes were not united together, and were weak in
their disunion.
</p>

<p>
These Philistines were a warlike people.  It is not
known precisely of what race they were.  Some have
thought that they were settlers from Crete, which held,
as we saw, rule over the sea.  Other scholars suppose
them to have been, like most of the peoples of that
region, a branch of the great Semitic tree which we have
seen spreading so widely.  But wherever they came
from, there they were established along this sea-coast,
a people ready to fight by land or sea, ready to go
trading, too, no doubt, in their ships, if they could
make profit by it&mdash;a bold, enterprising people.
</p>

<p>
And there was another people, settled along another
strip, farther north, of the same coast&mdash;the Phœnicians.
Almost exactly the same account is to be given of them.
They, too, were great sailors and navigators, great
traders, great pirates.  We do not hear so much about
them just at this point of the great story which we have
now reached: the Philistines play a bigger part in it
for the moment.  But the Phœnicians, you will see,
are far more important really, for in a few hundred
years the Philistines are little more heard of.  The
excellence of the Phœnicians as navigators made a
big difference to the story.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P97"></a>97}</span>
</p>

<p>
When the Israelites succeeded in pushing their army
thus into Palestine, westward of the Jordan river,
their victory was by no means complete.  It was a
long while before they got the better of those Philistines
near the coast, and at one time it looked very much
as if the Philistines would conquer them.  We may
suppose that they did not come up out of the desert
with much of the equipment necessary for the attack
of walled cities, such as I have just described that
necessary equipment to be.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Israel and Judah
</span>
</p>

<p>
The result of that was that even in the midst of
the country which, for the most part, they conquered,
there still remained certain strong cities in the hands
of their enemies.  Perhaps, as they had taken the
pasture lands, and all that they most wanted, and as
they saw that the capture of these strong places was
almost beyond their power, they came to some kind of
agreement with the citizens to leave those citizens in
possession of the cities, provided they were left in
peace elsewhere.  However that may be, it is certain
that some of those strong fortresses remained untaken
by them, and it happened that they were so placed as
to divide the country which the Israelites had overrun
into two parts.  The tribes of Judah and of Simeon
settled themselves in the country southward of this
line of fortresses, as we may almost call it.  The rest
of the tribes settled to the north.
</p>

<p>
I draw your attention to that, because it helps to
explain what happened later when the division took
place into the two kingdoms of Israel and Judah.
The tribes of Judah and Simeon, living in what came to
be called Judæa, of which Jerusalem was the capital,
were children of Israel, and of Abraham, just as much
as those who belonged to the kingdom of Israel so called.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P98"></a>98}</span>
</p>

<p>
It is a little confusing; and to save further confusion
it will I think be as well that I should now write
of these Israelites (including the inhabitants of Judæa)
as Hebrews.  The exact original meaning of the name
Hebrew is not very clear, but it was used at a very
early date, and we may use it conveniently to designate
the whole of the tribes that were led through their
wanderings in the desert by Moses and Aaron, and that
came up and crossed over Jordan, under Joshua, and
settled in Canaan.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
THE JEWS AND THE ISRAELITES
</h3>

<p>
If you will take a look on the map at all this country
of Palestine and Syria you will see how it is cut up by
mountains, the Lebanon range and others running
down along it.  One result of this must have been to
make it difficult for the tribes that were settled there
to unite and come together to resist the attacks of
enemies from without.
</p>

<p>
In order to understand this great story properly
you must bear in mind all through how much of it
happened as it did because of the geographical position&mdash;that
is to say, because the rivers ran just where they
did run and because the deserts and the seas and the
mountains lay just as they did lie round about the richer
and more pleasant land.  Between the mountains lay
plains and valleys where the flocks might pasture.
Canaan, you know, in the Bible is described as a land
"flowing with milk and honey."  Those are words
meant to give you the idea of a rich, pleasant land,
generally; but perhaps they mean a little more
besides.  "Flowing with milk" suggests a land where
cows for milking would do well, and as for honey, we
are told by people who have gone hunting there that
the dogs often come out of the grass and the wild
flowers quite yellow with pollen&mdash;the pollen that the
bees carry home with them on their thighs.  It is a
great country for bees and honey.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P100"></a>100}</span>
</p>

<p>
But it was also, when the Hebrews first made
their way into it, a great country for Philistines.  They
were not pleasant neighbours.  The early chapters of
the story of the Hebrews in Canaan are very much
taken up with fights against the Philistines.  The duel
between David and Goliath is almost the best of the
chapters; but the Samson story is very good reading
too.  At one moment the Philistines very nearly got
the better of the Hebrews altogether; but then it
seems as if the danger made Samuel, the greatest of the
Judges, realise that if the people were to be successful
against their Philistine enemies they must be united
under one head.  It was very largely by Samuel's act
that Saul was appointed, and anointed with the sacred
oil, as king&mdash;the first king of the now united tribes.
</p>

<p>
You know the rest of that story, very likely: how
they gradually got the better of these strong enemies,
how Saul slew his thousands and David his tens of
thousands, and how, under David's son, Solomon,
they came to the highest point of splendour and riches
and power that they ever reached.  The capital city
was Jerusalem in Judæa, the more southern part of
the kingdom.  It is not to be supposed that in the
fulness of its power this united kingdom had anything
to fear from fortress cities of enemies in their midst.
We may imagine all of them wiped out, because we
know that Solomon's ships went freely to the coasts
of Phœnicia, that cedar wood was brought from
the splendid cedar forests on Mount Lebanon, that
the wealth of Africa, in gold, ivory, apes and
peacocks came to him by caravan through Egypt or
by sea.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless the union lasted only a very short
while.  Under Solomon's sons the kingdom was divided.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
Rehoboam sitting on his father's throne in Jerusalem
and Jeroboam reigning over the kingdom of Israel in
the north.  We begin, about this time, to be tolerably
sure about the dates, and the date of this division into
the two kingdoms is given as 937 B.C.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The divided kingdom
</span>
</p>

<p>
So there they were&mdash;Israel, bounded by Syria on the
north, and with Assyria pressing on from the west and
coming now to the height of its power; Judah nearer
to Egypt and with the Assyrian power threatening it
scarcely less than Israel in the west.  The first trouble
from the big empires between which they lay fell on
Judah, from the Egyptian side.  Shishak, the Pharaoh
of Egypt, made Judah pay tribute to him, after coming
with a conquering army, and apparently some of the
Israelite tribes had to pay tribute also.  But Israel as
a whole did not come under his power.
</p>

<p>
As the story goes on we find the two kingdoms
engaged in small wars both with each other and with
the neighbouring small nations.  There was continual
fighting between the northern kingdom and Syria
farther to the north again.  The moment of Israel's
greatest strength was in the reign of Omri, who founded
its capital, Samaria.  But Syria was a more numerous
and powerful nation than Israel without the aid of
Judah; and Ahab, the Israelitish king, was a vassal
of Benhadad, king of Syria, whose capital city was
Damascus.  Ahab aided Benhadad in defending Syria
from the attack of Shalmaneser II. of Assyria, but the
allies were badly beaten, and Israel had to pay tribute
to Assyria.  She won back her independence for a short
time, when Assyria had other business to attend to,
but just so soon as Assyria had leisure to deal seriously
with Israel and Syria again, Samaria was taken.  The
Assyrians left them no opportunity for further revolt.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
As a nation, Israel disappears out of the story from the
year of the fall of Samaria, 722 B.C.
</p>

<p>
Assyria was now in the full tide of her power.  Once
the vassal of Babylon, she had now made Babylon a
vassal of hers.  Judah had escaped the fate of Israel
by prudently taking sides with Assyria.
</p>

<br>
SENNACHERIB IN HIS CHARIOT.
</p>

<p>
Egypt was not likely to be very pleased with this
interference on the part of Assyria with people whom
she looked on as her tributaries.  Judah and the
neighbouring small states must have been terribly
perplexed to know which was their wisest line to
take&mdash;submission to Assyria or to Egypt.  Egypt, at the
moment, was under a powerful dynasty of Ethiopian,
or what we should call negro, race.  She began to move
against the aggressive Assyrians, and under Hezekiah
Judah decided to take the Egyptian side.  A powerful
combination was formed against Assyria, which her
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
vassal Babylon joined, as well as some of the peoples
along the Mediterranean coast, the Philistines and
Phœnicians.  But as yet Assyria was too strong or
too clever in her fighting methods for them all.  The
Egyptian army, with the various allied forces, was
seriously beaten, and Jerusalem was saved only by the
payment of a very heavy tribute to Sennacherib, the Assyrian king.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The fall of Assyria
</span>
</p>

<p>
The power of Assyria was very great, and the Jews
may well have thought that they would find safety
under her protection.  Yet within less than a hundred
years, Assyria, as a great power, had ceased to exist, and
Judæa had once more to suffer for her alliance with the
beaten side.  Sennacherib's victory over the Egyptians
was in 701 B.C., and his son Ezar-haddon invaded and
occupied Egypt and held it for some ten years.  But
Assyria soon began to be pressed by a wild and
war-like people, the Scythians, coming from the north.
Then the Babylonians, allying themselves with the
Medes, a nation whose country lay on the north-west of
Babylonia, attacked Assyria from the south, and while
all this confusion and fighting was going on in the east,
Pharaoh Necho of Egypt thought the moment good
for trying to get back the old Egyptian provinces of
Palestine and Syria.
</p>

<p>
By the year 608 B.C. the Babylonians were besieging
Nineveh, the great capital city of the Assyrians, and
Necho was marching up into Palestine.  Syria and
Palestine, still faithful to the eastern empire, opposed
him, but were utterly defeated in a battle at Megiddo.
Once more Judah suffered by being on the losing side.
In 607, a year later, Nineveh was taken and its fortifications
razed to the ground by the victorious Babylonians.
The mighty Assyrian empire was no more.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
</p>

<p>
The explanation of this rapid fall of a people that
had been so powerful seems to be that it was a power
that depended entirely on its army, that the whole
nation was occupied in war, and that there were no
reserves, no population from which the armies could
be recruited and made strong again, when once those
already in the field began to be shaken.  It was, as we
should say, entirely a military state.  To the peoples
of Syria and Palestine we may suppose that it made
little difference whether Assyrians or Babylonians
were the great power in the east.  However that may
have been, they were still, like the horseshoe that a
blacksmith is making, "between the hammer and the
anvil."  It was now, as it had been a thousand or more
years before, between the hammer of Babylon and the
anvil of Egypt that they lay.
</p>

<p>
Nor, as we may suppose, did this change of power
in the east appear to make the position of Egypt very
different.  The Egyptian king may well have thought
that it gave him the better opportunity for extending
his own authority eastward and northward.  We have
seen how, in former years, Thothmes, and again
Thothmes III., advanced victoriously as far as
Carchemish, on the Euphrates.  Each set up a column there
as a monument to his victories.  But neither got
much farther.
</p>

<p>
And now again, in this later time, the Egyptian
king pressed up victoriously, and again the Babylonians
met him and gave him battle, at the very same
point&mdash;Carehemish.
</p>

<p>
If you will take a look at the map you will see,
perhaps, why it was that these names of battle-places
occur again and again.  Twice already we have had
great battles at Megiddo.  Three times Carehemish
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
seems to have been the turning-point in a campaign.
If we understand the geography, the way the land lies,
the rivers, mountains, plains and forests, we see the
reason.  In the first place, an army coming up northward
from Egypt would find a few strong cities perhaps,
such as Gaza and Ascalon, in the south, but after these
were passed it would come to a plain country which
gave the inhabitants no great opportunity of making a
strong defence till it came to the river Kishon, on which
is the city of Megiddo.  There begins a wooded and
mountainous country excellent for defence by a less
strong force against a stronger.
</p>

<p>
Then, if that line of defence was broken through,
the natural way&mdash;for it was the way that both traders
and fighters went&mdash;would be north eastward up through
Damascus and so on till you came to the Euphrates, a
great river, in itself a formidable defence, and there
stood the city of Carehemish.  That explains why
these two, Megiddo and Carehemish, were the places
of the great battles.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Nebuchadnezzar
</span>
</p>

<p>
I suppose that the greatest of them all, in its effect
on our story, was the third Carehemish battle which,
in the year 605 B.C., Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,
fought against the king of Egypt.  For the victory of
Babylon was so decisive that from this time forward,
for a long while, there seems to have been very little
question about which power was the greatest in the
world.  It was Babylon.
</p>

<p>
While Assyria and Babylon had been fighting
together, Pharaoh Necho, as we have seen, had taken
advantage of their trouble and had conquered the Jews
and some allied forces at Megiddo, and as a consequence
of that victory Judah had once again become subject
to Egypt.  Yet again, then, when Nebuchadnezzar
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P106"></a>106}</span>
won his great battle at Carchemish, the Jews were on
the side of the loser.  Even after Carchemish, they
seem to have inclined to the Egyptian, rather than to
the Babylonian alliance, perhaps because Egypt was
the nearer neighbour.  And they retained that
characteristic, which we have seen all through the story,
of being a stubborn people, with a spirit not easy to
subdue.  In 597 B.C. Nebuchadnezzar found them
giving trouble, and punished them by taking many of
the inhabitants, including the king and Ezekiel the
prophet, to Babylon.
</p>

<p>
But even so, within ten years the Jews that were
left in Jerusalem again tried to form alliances against
Babylon, and this time the great eastern power seems
to have resolved to make a final end of the business.
Jerusalem was attacked by a siege, and so resolutely
defended that it held out for nearly a year and a half;
but in the end it had to yield.  Its defending walls
and many of its chief buildings were overthrown, and,
most dreadful of all in the eyes of the Jews, their holy
temple of Jehovah was destroyed by fire after being
robbed of its valuable and sacred vessels.
</p>

<p>
The date of the Fall of Jerusalem is 586 B.C.  Surely
it must have seemed to the unhappy people, in spite of
the hope of return which even Jeremiah, the prophet
of all this terrible calamity, held out to them, that they
were wiped out as a nation.  The might of Babylon
must have appeared too great ever to be overthrown.
</p>

<p>
I have said so much about the Jews and their
misfortunes, although they were a people of so little
apparent importance in comparison with the great
empires on either side of them, because all that
happened to them, small nation though they were,
has been really of the very greatest importance in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P107"></a>107}</span>
making the story of the world what it is.  It is through
them, and by reason of these disasters, and others of
the same kind of which I will tell you soon, that they
were scattered all over the world.  And being thus
scattered, and holding to their traditions and to their
religion with a tenacity which no other people in the
whole story ever has shown, they took those traditions
and that religion everywhere.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The religion of the Jews
</span>
</p>

<p>
And here I would draw your attention to a fact
about the Jews and the Jewish religion which we are
rather apt to forget.  We are accustomed to speak of
Jews and Christians as if they were entirely opposed to
each other in every possible way, as if the one was
absolutely the opposite of the other.  And so, in one,
and perhaps the very most important, point of the
Christian religion they are, because the Jews deny the
divine nature of Christ which is the very chief point
in the Christian religion.  But, for all that, we must
never forget that it was on the Jewish religion that the
Christian religion was founded.  It was the religion
that came into the minds and hearts of men who had
been trained up in the Jewish religion.  The early
Christians were Jews, for the most part.  Christ
Himself was a Jew, brought up in the Jewish religion, and
we know that He said He came to "fulfil," not to
destroy.  He was, on His human side, the last of those
Hebrew prophets of whom the first, in point of time,
was Amos.
</p>

<p>
It was on the Jewish religion as its stock that the
Christian religion was grafted, as a gardener grafts a
new branch into an old stem and the new takes up the
sap from the old.  There was another branch later
grafted on the Jewish religious stem, besides the
Christian&mdash;a very different branch, the Mohammedan
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P108"></a>108}</span>
religion.  When we consider what an immense effect
Christianity in the first place, and Mohammedanism in
the second, have had in the making of this world-story,
we shall see, I think, that we are right in attributing a
great importance to what happened to the Jews, from
whom came these other religions, as well as their own,
which they still hold now.  What happened to them
was thus much more important in the story than what
far stronger powers did, such as the Hittites, who
possessed all Asia Minor and threatened Egypt, or the
Elamites; who nearly overthrew the Babylonians, or
the Syrians, who at one time were far stronger than
either Israel or Judah, or even both of them together.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Bible
</span>
</p>

<p>
We know that the Jews won their intense faith in
Jehovah, their national god, only with difficulty.
They were of the same race as the tribes about them
who worshipped Baal and Ashtaroth, and they were
constantly inclined towards that pagan worship, as
we know from the Bible.  But in the end the higher
religion won, and their religion was intensely real to
the Jews.  It was a very big thing in their lives.  They
believed that Jehovah punished them in this life for
the wrong things that they did, such as oppression of
the poor, or unjust dealing, and they believed that he
punished the nation for wrong things that the nation
did.  They had not the belief of the Egyptians in
reward and punishment in an after-life.
</p>

<p>
And they considered their god as an exacting, a
"jealous" god.  He would punish them if they
worshipped in the so-called "groves," which were
often posts or stones set up on the "high places" to the
pagan gods, or if they were slack in his worship, or in
making sacrifice to him.
</p>

<p>
All these peoples had, in common, a belief in winning
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P109"></a>109}</span>
the favour of the gods by sacrifice.  The more precious
to them the thing sacrificed, the more value they
deemed it would have in the sight of the gods; and that
is how it is that we see them at one time actually
sacrificing their own children, as the most valuable
offering that they could make.  The instance of
Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac will occur to
your minds.
</p>

<p>
And wherever they went, into whatever land of
exile they were carried by their conquerors, they would
take with them those sacred writings, that record of
their history, that story of the creation of the world,
and that code of their laws and of their religious
customs, which, with very much more that they had
not got, we now mean when we speak of the Bible.
Wherever they went they had this holy record assuring
them that they were the chosen people of Jehovah.
Among the influences which enabled them to keep so
distinct from the nations into whose midst they came,
we must surely place very high the influence of the
Bible&mdash;that is to say, of so many of its books as had been
written at that time.
</p>

<p>
The might of Babylon, as I have said, must have
seemed so great to the Jews, carried away into exile,
that it never could be overthrown.  And yet, within
less than fifty years from the siege and capture of
Jerusalem, Babylon itself was taken by a power of such
overmastering strength that the Babylonians only
once afterwards, and to no effect, attempted to regain
independence.
</p>

<p>
This extraordinary "judgment," as the Jews
regarded it, was executed by the hand of the Persians
under their great leader Cyrus.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
THE PERSIANS AND THE GREEKS
</h3>

<p>
The Persians are a people that up to this point come
into the story hardly at all.  Suddenly, out of the
East, they come right into its very centre and are the
principal actors in it for a century or two.
</p>

<p>
After the break-up of the Assyrian power, the
strongest nation in the alliance that had done that
breaking was the nation of the Medes.  The Medes and
Persians were of the same race, different altogether
from the Semitic.  They were of that great race called
Aryan, or Indo-European, that came from the high
lands in the centre of Asia.  Probably their numbers so
increased that they had to find new country.  They
pressed down southward and westward, towards the
sun and the more fertile lands.  They were hardy and
accustomed to moving about.  It was no hardship
to them to make migrations.  They moved with their
wives and children, flocks and herds, and all their small
household goods.  A great number pressed down into
India.  Another big stream flowing towards the west
came as far as the Babylonian eastern border.
</p>

<p>
These Aryan people from the north-west were great
riders.  It is thought that they introduced the horse
to the Babylonians, and that from the Babylonians it
came to Egypt.
</p>

<p>
The country of Elam had been invaded, and its
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P111"></a>111}</span>
power shattered, by the Assyrians shortly before the
break-up of their own empire, and this shattering,
together with the fighting between the Assyrians and
the alliance formed against them, gave the Persians
(who inhabited a country to the east called Iran, and
especially the part of that country called Persis) the
chance of getting possession of Elam.  This they did,
and established themselves in Susa, the old capital
city of the Elamites.  Persia was actually the vassal
of Media, until Cyrus, who was the Persian king at
Susa, led a revolt against them.  Within three years
he had conquered and taken their capital, and Media
was now a subject state to its own late subject, Persia.
</p>

<p>
Thus they were, then, established in their power
along the Eastern boundary of Babylonia, which had
now become the master empire by the defeat of Assyria.
Nevertheless Cyrus, at the head of the Persian army,
took this mighty Babylon without a battle!  But he
had to fight some hard battles first.  It seems that the
Medes had made treaties with their allies of Babylon
and Egypt which the Persians did not feel disposed to
pay attention to.  This aroused such opposition to the
Persians that an alliance of Babylonians and Egyptians
with Crœsus, king of Lydia in Asia Minor, and with the
Spartans, was formed against them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Spartan mercenaries
</span>
</p>

<p>
Notice particularly those Spartans.  Sparta was
the southern state of Greece, and this is the first
appearance of Greece in our story.  It is very notable.
These great nations of the East already thought so
well of the fighting qualities of the Greek soldiers,
and especially of the Spartan soldiers, that it was
worth their while to bring them over and pay them to
fight for them.  There seems to be little doubt that
they were mercenaries, that is to say, soldiers who were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
paid to fight and who fought for pay.  But the alliance
was of no avail.  Within the space of a few months,
in the summer of 546 B.C., the whole of Asia Minor was
in the Persian hands, right away to the Mediterranean
shore.  It was not until six years later that Cyrus had
leisure to attend to Babylon itself; but when he did
attend to it the resistance was not great.  The Babylonian
king's allies had been broken.  Cyrus took Syria
and Palestine also in his own reign, and after his
death his son Cambyses pressed on down into Egypt
and conquered that ancient land likewise.  The
victorious career of the Persians was only checked when
they came against the Ethiopians and Nubians in
farther Africa.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Persian conquest
</span>
</p>

<p>
Even the shore of the Mediterranean did not stay
their progress.  They won many of the Greek islands,
including Cyprus and Samos.  The empires of Egypt
and of Babylonia had been great, but this was greater
than both of them together.  And those two had been
rivals.  This of Persia seemed to be without a rival.
It is little wonder that the Persian ruler assumed the
title of King of Kings.  He ruled right away into
India.  He ruled all that seemed to matter or to count
for anything; and it had all been accomplished in not
much more than twenty years from the time of the
first revolt of Cyrus against the lordship of the Medes.
How was it done?
</p>

<p>
That is a question which must be answered in
different ways.  No one answer is enough.  There were
several causes which worked together for this astounding
success of the Persians.  But one of the chief
causes, if not the chief of all, was Cyrus.  We cannot
doubt that.  Throughout the whole of this greatest of
great stories which I am trying to tell you we shall
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P113"></a>113}</span>
not meet with an actor bigger and more glorious than
this Cyrus.  I doubt whether we meet with another
quite as big.  For not only were the extent of country
and the power of the nations that he conquered
extraordinarily great, but he made a very extraordinary use
of his conquests.  He must have been a great leader
of men, a man whom others were ready to obey and
follow; and he must have been a great general, according
to the ideas of what generalship and the manœuvring
of armies meant at that time; but besides all that he
must have been a very wise man and a very good man.
There can be little doubt that he was far more
merciful to the people that he conquered than any
other conqueror that has come into our story yet.  He
treated them with far greater kindness.  That is proof
of his goodness.
</p>

<p>
Then he was very content to leave them their own
institutions, including their religions, so long as they
were obedient to him as their over-lord.  That shows
his wisdom, for it meant that the people he conquered
were content to be under him.  Under Cyrus, the Jews
who were in exile at Babylon were allowed to go back
to Jerusalem, and he gave orders which helped them to
the re-building of the Temple there.  It is thought that
it was partly by the help of these Jews in Babylon that
he was able to take that strong city, as he did, without
a fight.  But it is said that he had to divert part of the
stream of the Euphrates in order to do so; and it is
certain that he had already broken the Babylonian
power before he took the capital.
</p>

<p>
He was able to show this kindness and consideration
for the religion of other peoples, because his own
religion and that of his Persians was a very enlightened
one.  I think we shall not do wrong in calling it the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P114"></a>114}</span>
most enlightened religion of all that we find before
Christ came.  It was the religion called Zoroastrianism,
from the name of its founder, Zoroaster, who is also
called Zarathustra.  It was the religion of those
Indo-European people of whom we have seen one part
pressing down south into India and another part
pressing westward.  Zoroaster is thought to have been
the author of the most ancient portions of what is
called the Zend-Avesta, which means the Avesta, or
Sacred Writings, written in the language of Zend.
Zend belongs to the Aryan group of the Indo-European
family of languages, from another branch of which our
own native English language has been derived.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Zoroaster
</span>
</p>

<p>
Zoroaster taught that there is one great and good
god, Ormuzd, but that there is also another supernatural
being, Ahriman, the spirit of evil.  It is accordingly
as men do the will of Ormuzd, that is to say, do
good acts, that they will have a happy life after death.
If the good acts a man has done in life here are more in
number and importance than his bad acts he will go to
paradise; if the bad acts are more than the good he will
go to hell and suffer everlasting punishment.  Justice,
acting justly, was what Zoroaster recognised as the
most important thing of all.
</p>

<p>
You will see at once how near this very ancient
belief comes to that which we hold now, and how much
more enlightened it is than other religions which we
have noticed.  It contains the idea of one god supreme
over all the universe&mdash;not only supreme for a single
nation or for one portion of the earth.
</p>

<p>
Fire, that mysterious, useful, kindly thing by which
man warms himself, by which he cooks his food, and
which, nevertheless, is capable of such horrible
destruction, seems to have been associated closely with the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P115"></a>115}</span>
power of the good god, Ormuzd.  Fire was therefore a
sacred element.
</p>

<p>
The cow, another kindly thing, because of its use to
man, was also sacred.  In the religion which Zoroaster
was brought up in the cow had been sacrificed to ward
off evils&mdash;with the idea, already noticed, that the more
precious to man the thing that he sacrificed, the more
favour his sacrifice would win with the gods.  Zoroaster
taught that it was impious to kill the cow.
</p>

<p>
It was with this fine and enlightened religion in
their hearts, then, that Cyrus and his Persians came
conquering the western world.  They conquered, but
they treated those that they conquered with justice,
according to the great teaching of Zoroaster.  As they
believed in one god over all the earth, they might permit
the worship of that god to be carried on according to
the various customs that they found where they went, so
long as those customs were not altogether base and evil.
</p>

<p>
And these Persians were a kindly people.  That is
one of the causes of their victories.  In the great
story we find this often repeated&mdash;that a people living
in a mountainous country, in a severe climate,
and in surroundings which make their lives difficult
and their food hard to get, come down on the
inhabitants of a country where the soil is more fertile,
the climate milder, and life altogether easier, and
drive these easy-going people out before them as if
they were sheep running away before wolves.  It is a
happening which teaches the lesson that the strongest,
the most effective, kind of men are those that are
accustomed to hardship.
</p>

<p>
But it is quite clear from all we have seen that
those whom the Persians thus conquered were practised
warriors.  They were constantly fighting.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P116"></a>116}</span>
Persians, however, seem to have come upon them with
a kind of fighting to which they were not altogether
accustomed.  The difference between their methods
was chiefly that the Persians were so much quicker
in movement.  They were fine archers, and they were
very fine horsemen.  It was this last, their
horsemanship, which seems to have been one of the great
secrets of their success.  They had archers both on
horse and on foot, but on horse especially.  Their
method was to dash down upon the enemy in a swift
attack, the cavalry opening out to let the archers on foot
shoot their arrows.  Then, when they had harassed the
enemy with this swift charge, it was not their way to
come to close quarters with him, at all events at the
first onset, but rather to retire as quickly as they came
on, to re-form, and to come back to the attack again.
</p>

<p>
The enemy, on their retirement, if he did not know
their way of fighting, was rather apt to think that they
were retreating altogether and were giving up the
attack.  Then the enemy was inclined to start off in
pursuit.  That was exactly what suited the Persians,
for it meant that when they returned for the next
attack they found the enemy more broken up than
before and less able to resist.  It was by repeated onsets
of this nature that they got the formation of an opposing
army knocked to pieces; and then, in a final attack,
this time pressed closely home, they might, and they
generally did, defeat him.
</p>

<p>
But if it was thus a new style of fighting that the
Persians brought with them from the east, they also
found themselves encountering a mode of defence
against their attack which was strange to them.  And
this mode of defence came from the west.
</p>

<p>
In that allied army which we saw the Persians
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
defeating in Asia Minor&mdash;the army led by Crœsus, king
of Lydia&mdash;the Persians were victorious.  They were so
decisively victorious that Crœsus himself was taken
prisoner by them, and the whole strength seems to have
been knocked out of the alliance by that single blow.
And in the defeated army we saw that there were
soldiers from Sparta, which is, as you see on the map,
in that most southern and almost detached part of
Greece which is called the Peloponnese.  The Spartans,
therefore, were Greeks, and the Greeks were among
those that had the worst of it in this great battle.  But,
for all that, it was a Grecian mode of fighting that
made the best of all defences against the Persian way
of attacking.  This mode of defence is what was called
the "phalanx."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
City states
</span>
</p>

<p>
You have to understand that the word Greece in
those days did not mean a single nation so much as a
collection of small states settled close beside one another.
The peoples of the different states were for the most
part of the same race, no doubt, just like the Semitic
peoples in Syria and Palestine.  But they differed
from each other in their customs and their ways of
government far more than the Semites did.  They
were very often fighting among themselves and, again
like the Semites, found it very difficult to let their
jealousy of each other die down and to unite together
for defence against a foreign foe.  The Spartans were
the most warlike of all the Grecian states.  Their
government was conducted in such a way as to make
all the males in the country fighters.
</p>

<p>
Their idea of fighting was as different as possible
from that of the Persians.  They had few horse-soldiers.
They were drawn up for battle in a close deep
formation, I suppose like what we should call "a solid
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P118"></a>118}</span>
square," and it was this solid square that was called
the phalanx.  The troops were heavily armed, with
shield, sword, and, most important of all for receiving
the charge of cavalry, with long spears.  You can
imagine what a solid defence this would make against
the lightly armed cavalry of the Persians.  The arrows
would not cause very serious loss to the armoured
and shielded Greeks, and when the Persians did finally
push their charge home
the spears would so receive
them that it would be like
charging a gigantic porcupine.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-118"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-118.jpg" alt="GREEK WARRIOR.">
<br>
GREEK WARRIOR.
</p>

<p>
Of course all that would
depend on the phalanx
keeping its solid formation.
If its ranks got at all
broken up in pursuit, under
the mistaken idea that the
Persians, after the first
onslaught, were done with,
and were fleeing away, then
it would be a very much
less formidable porcupine
on which the horsemen
would come when they
returned to the attack.  Probably the Greeks quickly
learnt the Persians' methods and grew careful to keep
their formation without any big breaks in it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The phalanx
</span>
</p>

<p>
These heavily armed soldiers of the Greeks were
called hoplites.  After a while the phalanx was assisted
by lighter armed and more swiftly moving troops
called peltasts, but the solid phalanx was always the
great strength of their armies.  The peltasts were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P119"></a>119}</span>
never regarded as of equal importance with the hoplites,
though they were very valuable assistants to the
phalanx.  The Greeks, living in a comparatively small
country with the sea on either side of them, had not
the same chance of getting horses for a numerous
cavalry as the nations that had all Asia or all the
north-eastern parts of Europe to draw on for their supply.
</p>

<p>
This phalanx of the Greeks is a very important
feature in the great story.  It was chiefly, as we may
suppose, by reason of their adopting this formation
and making such splendid use of it, that they were
sought after, as we know that they were, by other
nations to come to the assistance of their own armies.
There grew up in Greece a class of what we may call
professional soldiers, ready to hire themselves out for
pay, to fight on any side that would make it worth
their while to do so.  We find them thus, as what
we call "mercenaries," fighting sometimes for the
Egyptians, sometimes against them.  Some of them we
even find fighting for the Persians.  And they scarcely
ceased fighting among themselves.  The Persian
empire extended to Egypt, and to all the eastern shore
of the Mediterranean, but it was not powerful enough
to prevent much fighting between the peoples subject
to it.  It could not, however, prevail much against
Greece, in spite of the divisions between the Greek
states.
</p>

<p>
Our story now, say after 500 B.C., or thereabouts,
is concerned very much with the vain attempts of the
Persians to subjugate the Greeks&mdash;to get them under
their yoke.  And again I must remind you, to get the
picture at all clear and full, that the Mediterranean
was continually being ravaged by the ships of pirates
and traders&mdash;ready to be peaceful merchants if it paid
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P120"></a>120}</span>
them better to be so, or to attack other shipping or
coast towns if they could do so with success.
</p>

<p>
The Peoples of the Sea was the old name for these
raiders and traders, who were of all nations, sometimes
combining together, and making themselves into
quite a powerful navy, with headquarters in Crete
or another of the many islands.  The most powerful,
as a nation, of any of these sea-raiders were the
Phœnicians.  They planted many settlements along the
coasts, either on islands or on easily defended projecting
headlands of the main shores.  Such places were of
value to them for their ships to run into when beset
by storms or by enemies.  The most important in our
story was their settlement at Carthage.  This Carthage
will play a very big part later on.
</p>

<p>
But now we must take a look at the very remarkable
part which Greece was playing at this moment,
500 B.C. or so, and had played for some years and was
to play for many to come.  I expect you will have
wondered that I have not spoken about Homer and the
famous Siege of Troy, and other great men and great
events which happened long before this time.  Troy
began to be besieged very shortly after 1200 B.C.
Homer lived at some time between 800 and 900 B.C.
We have left them far behind.
</p>

<p>
The reason why I did not pick them up and fit
them into their place in the story when we came to the
years of their happening is that the part played by
Greece in the making of this great story&mdash;that is to say,
in the making of the world&mdash;is different from the part
played by any other people.  It is such a different
part that it is almost another story, although it does
really fit into the great story and is a very important
part of it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P121"></a>121}</span>
</p>

<p>
The other great peoples that we have been talking
about, the Egyptians, Babylonians, and Persians,
conquered vast countries, founded vast empires.  The
Greeks did nothing of this kind.  They were fine and
accomplished soldiers, as we have seen, but the various
states were too disunited for them to be able to bring
their forces together or to keep them for any length of
time together.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The genius of Greece
</span>
</p>

<p>
But for many centuries they were by far the most
accomplished people in the world; their artists, both
painters and sculptors, were far ahead of the rest;
their thinkers went deeper and with more clear insight
and wisdom than any others into the many problems
and puzzles that life and the world set for us; they had
finer sculptors, finer orators, finer poets, probably they
had finer musicians; we have seen that they had a
finer battle formation.
</p>

<p>
In fact, in cleverness and in all the arts and sciences
the Greeks were not only superior to all those about
them, but they were superior to all that have been
since&mdash;even to ourselves, though we have had all these
years in which to learn.  We have learnt to make
trains go, and the telephone and poison gases, and guns
that will shoot twenty-five miles, and other things of
that kind.  But we are not the equals of the Greeks
of 500 B.C. in art, oratory, poetry or philosophy.  Had
it not been for the Greek philosophers we cannot tell
what our philosophy might have been, for it is built
up on the foundations they laid; but we may doubt
whether it would have been nearly as far-seeing or as
interesting.
</p>

<p>
And that is really the most important part that the
Greeks took in the making of the story&mdash;a part quite
different from that of the great empire-makers, and yet,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P122"></a>122}</span>
as I think you will agree, a bigger part than any of
theirs.  For it made, or did a great deal to make, the
thought of the world what it is to-day.  It did a great
deal to make the thought of the world what it was all
down the pages of the story, say from 1200 B.C. onwards.
I mean that it made men think about things&mdash;about
art and philosophy and music, and about life in
general&mdash;as they do think.  Had it not been for the Greeks
we should be thinking differently, and probably not
nearly so wisely, about all these things.  That is the
greatest work that the Greeks have done in the world.
</p>

<p>
You may remember that we said the disasters
which befell the Jews, and their scattering throughout
the other nations, made them able to take their
religious ideas with them, and to sow those ideas, as it
were seeds from which plants should spring, amongst
those nations into which they were driven.  Something
like the same kind of scattering happened to the
Greeks, and so enabled them to carry their ideas over
a great part of the world.  Of their own accord they
would, no doubt, have carried them far.  If you look
at the map of Greece, you will see that not only has the
country the sea on three sides of it, but that it is cut
up, and cut into, by a wonderful number of bays
and gulfs of the sea, so that it would have a very
great length of seashore if all were added together.
Naturally that meant that the Greeks were great
sea-goers.  They were a great "maritime" people, as we
should say&mdash;from <i>mare</i>, which is Latin for sea.  A
good deal of their excellence in art we may suspect that
they derived from those ancient Minoans whom we saw
masters of Crete very long ago.  The Minoans, as the
Minotaur legend showed us, were masters of Athens
also.  They were the great sea-power in very ancient
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P123"></a>123}</span>
times.  They left evidences of their art at Mycenæ in
Greece.  The Greeks, following the Minoans in art,
perhaps followed them also in the skilful management
of ships.  We know, at all events, that they went far
and wide on the Mediterranean in ships, certainly as
great traders, probably often as pirates, and, whether
the one or the other, taking their thoughts, their arts,
their culture with them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The expansion of the Greeks
</span>
</p>

<p>
But besides this&mdash;beside these expeditions which
they went of their own will, and beside the further
spread of their culture, which their soldiers, going out
to fight for hire, would carry with them&mdash;some or other
of the Greeks were from time to time in the course of
the story obliged to fly over-sea, obliged to save
themselves from the pressure of enemies coming down on
them from the north.
</p>

<p>
It is exactly what we saw happening in Babylonia
that happened here too in Greece.  It is exactly what
happened again and again in the great story&mdash;the
peoples from a wild barren country come pressing down
upon peoples living in a more fertile one.  Out of
Thrace, which you will see on the map lying to the
north of Greece, down through Macedonia and Thessaly,
came wild warlike tribes pressing on the peoples of the
more fertile south.  Various reasons for their
movements are given by the Greeks who left their native
country and settled, some in the islands, some in Asia
Minor.  In some instances it was admitted that they
went under pressure of enemies; but that is not a
reason which would be very pleasant to their pride.
Other reasons were recorded, but probably this was
really the most common.
</p>

<p>
In their sailings to and fro, and tradings, they would
learn about the countries on the Mediterranean shores.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P124"></a>124}</span>
Even if they had not full knowledge of it before, they
would have learnt all that they needed to know about
the western shore of Asia Minor in the course of the
ten years which are assigned to the Siege of Troy.
</p>

<p>
Ilus was father of Tros, king of Troy, and the
Greeks called Troy Ilium, after Ilus, rather than after
the son Tros from whom the name Troy came.  And
the Iliad is therefore the story of Ilium, otherwise
called Troy.  This splendid poem is attributed to
Homer as its author, but what Homer probably did
was to recite, or to sing to the accompaniment of the
lyre, these stories, which were only written down years
afterwards.  We may imagine him something like the
bard or the troubadour.  How much of his own
invention he added to the story we cannot know.
</p>

<p>
The story, as we have it from him, is that Queen
Helen having been taken from her home, with her own
willing consent, by Paris and carried to Troy, the
Greeks went after her and tried to get her back.  They
tried for the whole ten years which are ascribed to the
Siege of Troy.  Helen was the most beautiful lady in
the world, and the Iliad is certainly one of the most
beautiful poems.
</p>

<p>
But can we believe the story?
</p>

<p>
The Greeks were a singularly intelligent people.
Does it seem the act of any intelligent people to go on
fighting for ten years in order to get back even the most
beautiful lady in the world?  And if they were at all
intelligent they would certainly be apt to reflect that
she would not be likely to be equally beautiful at the
end of the ten years as she was at the beginning.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Siege of Troy
</span>
</p>

<p>
A very learned Grecian scholar, Dr. Walter Leaf,
has written a book about the Siege of Troy which tells
the story in a much less romantic and poetical but a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P125"></a>125}</span>
much more probable way.  And I want to tell that
story, as he tells it, very shortly to you, because it
gives such a good idea of the way that men were living
along the shore of Asia Minor at that time, say 1200 or
so B.C.
</p>

<p>
Troy, you will see if you look at the map, stands,
or stood, nearly in the north-western corner of Asia
Minor, its territory reaching up to the shore of that
narrow sea-channel which used to be called the
Hellespont and is now called the Dardanelles.  Any Greek
ships wishing to go for trade through the Hellespont
must pass close along the coast of Troy land, so close
that any people who had the command of the land could
sally out and interfere with their passage.  The current
flows out westward through the Hellespont, and the
wind usually blows from north-west, against the ships
going eastward.
</p>

<p>
The whole point of Dr. Leaf's argument is that at
Troy there was a market, or fair, at which the produce
of the countries in the east was sold to the Greeks and
other people in the west, and that the Trojans derived
much profit from this market.  The profit from this
market they would of course lose if the western people
were able to sail up through the Hellespont and do
their trade direct with the people along the shore of
the Black Sea.  The Trojans were, in fact, what we
nowadays call "middle-men," and you know how we
are always trying to bring the consumer, the person
who wants to use the thing produced, into direct touch
with the producer, and so to do away with the profit
which the middle-man charges and which he again puts
on to the price of the thing when he sells it to the
consumer.  The Greeks were the consumers.  They
wanted to do away with the middle-men, that is to say
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P126"></a>126}</span>
with the Trojans, and that, far more probably than the
bringing back of the beautiful lady, was why they
spent so many years and so many lives in the siege of
Troy.
</p>

<p>
You will remember what we said before about the
kind of ships that these people had.  They were
propelled by rowing, or by sails which were only useful
when the wind was nearly directly behind them.  They
had to put in to some harbourage every night, because
they did not dare to go along in the dark, without
charts and without compass and without knowledge
of how to steer by the stars.  Even in daytime they
hardly dared to go out of sight of land and of the
landmarks which they knew.
</p>

<p>
The islands in these seas lie so close to each other
that it was possible for them to creep along in this way
from one to the other and so to the coasts of Asia from
Greece.  And there was another reason why they could
not go long voyages&mdash;they had no light cisterns in which
to carry fresh water.  They had to take it in heavy
earthern jars.
</p>

<p>
This need for water they could supply from rivers
which ran out westward through Troy land.  They
would lie along the coast there, as they traded with the
Trojan middle-men, or, possibly, as they waited for a
favouring wind to go through the Hellespont, which
the Trojans might allow them to do on payment of
some toll money, as we should call it, for the permission.
</p>

<p>
The reasons for thinking that the wish to do away
with these Trojans and their market was the real
motive of the ten years' war are strengthened when we
look at the names of the peoples that came to the help
of the Greeks on the one side and of the Trojans on the
other.  Those that came to the assistance of the Greeks
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P127"></a>127}</span>
were the peoples along the Mediterranean shores or
on the islands; those that aided the Trojans were the
peoples from the east.  So we have the two set in rather
distinct opposition to each other; the Trojans and the
eastern people who sent their things to the market at
Troy and had an interest in the market being kept up,
and the western peoples who wanted the market
destroyed.
</p>

<p>
That is a very prosaic story, is it not, in comparison
with the romance about the beautiful lady?  It is not
the kind of story that Homer or any other bard would
care to sing or his listeners would take pleasure in
hearing.  But I am afraid it is more likely to be the
true story of the reason why a practical and intelligent
people like the Greeks fought so hard and so long to
annihilate Troy.  I have said so much about this
famous siege because it gives such a good opportunity
of setting what are probably the facts beside the
fictions which have been founded on them.  It teaches
us how these poetic stories were made.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Odyssey
</span>
</p>

<p>
The other great poem attributed to Homer, the
Odyssey, is only another chapter, dealing with the
adventures of one of the principal Greek heroes, of
the story of the siege.  It is even more glorious reading
than the Iliad itself.
</p>

<p>
Now, whatever the truth be about the Trojan war,
one fact is quite clear and certain from its story, as well
as from other evidence, that the Greeks had dealings,
constant dealings, with Asia Minor.  Therefore their
thought, their art, their culture, and all that was most
remarkable in their character as a nation, was known
in Asia Minor, it was known among all these islands of
the Ægean Sea and along the southern, the African,
shores of the Mediterranean.  Everywhere that it went
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
it was superior to the thought and the culture of the
native people, and everywhere it had its effect.  I want
you to realise that.  It was not by reason of the force
of their arms, though they were such good fighters,
that the Greeks count for so much in our great story,
but by reason of the force of their thought, and of their
accomplishments.
</p>

<p>
Some hundred or two hundred years after the siege
of Troy we find certain colonies or cities of the Greeks
founded along the western shore of Asia Minor.  The
Greeks living in these cities were called Ionians.
Shortly before the coming of Cyrus, the all-conquering
Persian, those Ionians had been conquered by that
king Crœsus of Lydia whom we saw taking command
of that ill-fated alliance formed against Persia.  The
Persian had now, by the time, 500 B.C., to which we
have brought down the story, made himself master of
all Asia Minor.  The Ionian cities had come under his
dominance.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
THE GLORIOUS DAYS OF GREECE
</h3>

<p>
It is amusing to stop now and then in the course of a
story to wonder how it would have gone if one or other
of the events in it had happened rather differently.
Sometimes it seems as if just one event turned the
whole course of what happened afterwards.
</p>

<p>
So here in this great story of ours we may wonder
what would have happened to the world if the Persians,
pushing their way westward, had not come up against
that strong wall of opposition which they found in the
Greek phalanx.  There was no other power, so far as
we know, at this time, in the west, that was at all likely
to be able to stop them.
</p>

<p>
If we look at what happened in the more southward
direction of their advance, in Egypt, we shall perhaps
be inclined to think that they would not have gone
very much farther westward than they did, for the
Egyptian story of that time shows that they were not
able to establish their power very securely in that
country.  For nearly forty years after the Persian
conquest of Egypt by Cambyses, the son of Cyrus,
Egypt was held as a province of Persia, but in 488
B.C. the Egyptians made a successful revolt and threw off
the Persian yoke for a time.  Three years later they
were again subdued by Xerxes, who was then king of
Persia, but only fifteen years afterwards they were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P130"></a>130}</span>
again revolting, and through the whole of that century,
500 to 400 B.C., they were continually rising against
their Persian masters, never quite succeeding in winning
their freedom, but constantly giving trouble, never
completely subdued.  It is evident that the Persians,
after their first and most effective conquest, never had
a very secure hold over the people of the Nile.
</p>

<p>
Then, if we turn to look at what was going on
farther north, where the Persian cavalry were coming
up against that famous Greek phalanx, we shall see
good reason why the Persians were not able to give a
great deal of attention to making their position good in
Egypt.  The wonder is that they should have found
any forces at all to spare for that enterprise.
</p>

<p>
The Persian monarch had assumed the title of King
of Kings.  He claimed dominion over the whole world,
as the Persians knew it.  It must have been most
vexatious to him, and to that great claim and title of
his, to find the claim opposed and contested.  He had
conquered Greeks before&mdash;those Spartans whom he
had met fighting in the alliance under King Crœsus.
He would conquer them again.  He would crush them
and take possession of their country.
</p>

<p>
After all that they had accomplished, the conquest
of Greece cannot have seemed to the Persians as if it
would be a hard matter.  Greece, as a single nation,
did not exist.  There were many Grecian states, but
they were always fighting among themselves, each
striving for the supremacy.  The chief of the fighting
states were Sparta and Athens.  Each of these would
form alliances from time to time with other states to
fight against the other.  Just at this moment, that is
just before 500 B.C., the contention between them was
most severe.  The forms of the government in the two
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P131"></a>131}</span>
were sharply opposed.  The government of Athens
had lately fallen into the hands of the people.  The
people, the democracy (from <i>demos</i>, the people, and
<i>kratos</i>, power) had deposed their king and driven him
out of the country.  The Spartans, who hated the idea
of a democratic government, sympathised with him, and
no doubt would have restored him to power had they
been able to do so; but he went to Asia Minor, to the
court of Darius, who was then king of Persia, and
besought his help.  The Persian was very willing to
give it, but it was not until some years later, in 490 B.C.,
that the first actual invasion of Greece by the Persians
took place.  That invasion practically began and
ended with what was one of the most famous battles
in the world's history, the battle of Marathon.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Marathon
</span>
</p>

<p>
It was fought on a small plain, only some three miles
wide, on the seashore, where the Persians had disembarked
their forces.  And here I would give you a word
of warning which must apply to all this story of the
glorious days of Greece.  The battles&mdash;Marathon,
Thermopylæ, and Salamis&mdash;have become very famous, and
rightly famous.  They were of importance in the story
because they&mdash;Marathon and Salamis, at all events,
which were Grecian victories&mdash;put a stop to that
westward advance of the Persians which might have
extended we cannot say how far but for those victories.
But they were battles in which the forces engaged on
the one side or the other were almost ridiculously small
in comparison with the armies which we have seen put
into the field.  They were fought over very small
spaces of land or sea, and they were very quickly over.
</p>

<p>
But though they are rightly famous, for the reason
which I have spoken of, a good deal of their fame is due
to the splendid way in which their story has been told
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P132"></a>132}</span>
to us by the great historian Herodotus, and, as you
know, the best story in the world can be made to seem
very poor if it is badly told; and a poor story can be
made interesting by good telling.  These people, these
Greeks, with their extraordinary accomplishments,
had the power of telling stories very well, and
the stories really were good in themselves.  They
were good stories, and stories of important events,
but the events are rather apt to appear even more
important than they really were, just because their
story is told so very well.
</p>

<p>
That is the word of warning which I want to give
you about all these stories of the glorious days of
Greece.
</p>

<p>
In giving you the outlines of the great story of the
world, as I am trying to do in this book, there is no
space for an account of these battles.  You must read
about them elsewhere, and all I can do is to tell you
how they fit into the big story, where they come, and
how it was that they happened.  The Greeks, at this
battle of Marathon, defeated the Persians and utterly
demolished any chance of the success which this first
invasion of Greece by the Persians could have had.
The Persians returned again to the attack, but it was
not until ten years later; and then it was attempted
in a different manner.
</p>

<p>
There had been an effort at the invasion of Greece
even before that which was defeated at Marathon.
Those Ionian cities along the coast of Asia Minor had
revolted against the Persian rule, and had been aided
by the Athenians, who were closely related to them.
A Persian expedition had set out four years before
the Marathon enterprise to punish the Athenians for
helping the Ionians in that revolt which the Persians
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P133"></a>133}</span>
had easily repressed.  It set out both by land and sea,
with the intention that the fleet should support the
land army, but the fleet was caught and shattered in a
storm, and although the Persian power was supposed
to be established over Thrace and even as far west as
Macedonia, their land army was fallen upon and
broken up by attacks of the wild tribes on the borders
of Thrace without ever reaching Greek territory at all.
</p>

<p>
But though this expedition, thus planned to act
together by land and sea, had been a failure, it was just
the same kind of enterprise, only on a far larger scale,
that was attempted by Xerxes, then King of Kings,
ten years after the Persian overthrow at Marathon.
King Xerxes himself was the leader.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Xerxes
</span>
</p>

<p>
I think we may be safe in saying that no forces as
large as these, in the number of men enrolled in them,
had ever before been collected for a military purpose,
and also that no former expedition had ever been
planned with so much care and forethought.  Xerxes
made two bridges for the passing of his army across the
Hellespont; he cut a canal through the Isthmus at
Mount Athos for the passage of his fleet.  The fleet,
you see, if you will look at the map, would coast
round along the south of Thrace, accompanying the
army, till it came to the Peninsula at the end of which
is Mount Athos.  Xerxes had established stations in
Thrace for the supply of his army with food and all
needful things as it went along.  It was just off Mount
Athos that the storm had scattered the fleet of the
former expedition that he had sent against Greece.
By making this canal, and so letting the ships go
through the Isthmus, he avoided the danger of another
storm off the end of the Peninsula.
</p>

<p>
But there were other dangers besides those from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P134"></a>134}</span>
the wind and waves, for a fleet in any part of the
Mediterranean.  Although the Persian monarch might
style himself King of Kings, there was another power
that ruled the sea at this time, the power of Carthage,
that colony of the Phœnicians of which I asked you to
take note the first time that it found a place in this
story.  The Phœnicians, as we have seen, had planted
colonies of their own at all convenient places along the
Mediterranean shore, and of all these Carthage had
grown to be by far the strongest in its numbers.  It
was regarded as the capital city, the headquarters, of
all that half-merchant and half-pirate host which we
have seen always going to and fro on the waters of the
great inland sea.  For fifty years and more before the
battle of Marathon was fought it had become a great
power, the chief naval power of the world, and it had
already come into collision with the Greeks.
</p>

<p>
For the Greeks, too, as we know, sent out their
colonies.  They sent them to Ionia, eastward along
the coast of Asia Minor, and they also sent them
westward, round the heel and toe of Italy, as far
as that great island of Sicily lying nearly opposite
to where you see Carthage on the African shore.  Sicily
and the African continent lie at no great distance from
each other at the nearest points.  And the Carthaginians
and other Phœnicians had come into conflict
with the Greek colonists in Sicily long before Greece
was threatened by the Persians.  Xerxes, before
making his attempt on Greece, assured himself that his
fleet would not be attacked by the great naval power,
by making an alliance with Carthage.  Phœnician
ships were among the best that fought for him.  His
plans seem to have been laid with every possible care
and completeness.  The overthrow of Greece, and of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P135"></a>135}</span>
that liberty which all Grecian states, in spite of their
jealousy of each other and of their incessant quarrels,
prized so very highly, seemed certain.  It looked as if
the King of Kings, who would rule absolutely, according
to the Eastern idea, was sure to bring them under his
subjection.  The danger was so great that for the
moment the states of Greece were able to put their
jealousies on one side.  Athens and Sparta, and the
less powerful states with which one or other was in
alliance at the time, drew together.  It was a terrible
moment for them.
</p>

<p>
The first great battle of the war made it more
terrible still.
</p>

<p>
Command of the united land forces of Greece
fell, naturally, into the hands of Sparta.  The utmost
that they were able to gather was but little over 5000
men, of which no more than 500 were actually
Spartans.  The smallness of the force may give us
an idea of the small population of those city states of
Greece.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Thermopylæ
</span>
</p>

<p>
With this gallant body of defenders Leonidas, the
Spartan general, encountered the Persian host in the
narrow mountain pass of Thermopylæ.  It was a
situation in which the Persian could make little or no
use of his strongest arm, the cavalry, and he was held
back, with heavy loss to his soldiers, so much less
heavily armed than the Greeks.  How that battle
would have gone had it been prolonged, we cannot
know, for a traitor, one of the great traitors of history,
revealed to the Persians another pass across the
mountains.  They had partly traversed that other
pass, and were already threatening the flank and rear
of his army, when Leonidas was informed of their
movement.  He knew his position to be hopeless.  He
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P136"></a>136}</span>
bade the allied troops, who were not his countrymen,
retreat and find safety if they could.  As for himself
and his devoted band of Spartans, they sallied out of
the pass, threw themselves on the Persian masses,
and went down fighting to the death, an example of
gallantry to all future ages.
</p>

<p>
And Athens, Athens lying, as you see, right before
the victors once they had come through the difficult
pass&mdash;what hope was there for her?  None.  Her
doom seemed certain.
</p>

<p>
The Athenians saved themselves by a sacrifice that
has perhaps only been equalled by the Russians when
they burnt their capital of Moscow at the approach
of Napoleon's grand army.  They quitted their loved
city; they left it to be destroyed by the Persians, and
moved themselves and their households to islands
nearest the coast where they would be under the
protection of their ships, which had not yet encountered
the Persian fleet.  Of these islands one was named
Salamis, and between the island and the mainland the
Greeks and Persians met in that naval battle which
saved Greece.  The Persian fleet was utterly defeated.
The danger from the sea had vanished.  The army of
the Persians remained, victorious, in possession of all
the territory of Athens.  But it had lost the support
of its ships.
</p>

<p>
It was an age of heroes.  I do not suppose that any
other great victory was due so largely to the genius
and determination of one single man as this at Salamis
to the Athenian admiral Themistocles.  The King of
Kings, however, did not behave in any very heroic
manner.  He scuttled back with the broken remnants
of his fleet to his own shores.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Platæa
</span>
</p>

<p>
The following year made the repulse of the Persians
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P137"></a>137}</span>
complete.  Their army was defeated in a great battle
at Platæa, and on the very same day the Grecian fleet
engaged and again badly beat the fleet which the
Persians had managed to reform.  But this time it
was not the Persian fleet that was threatening the
coast of Greece.  This second naval fight was off the
coast of Asia Minor, by a headland from which the
battle had its name&mdash;Mycale.
</p>

<p>
That day made an end of the Persian threat to
Greece.  It did more; it gave the Greeks a sense that
they were a stronger folk than the Persians, if they
met in conditions and numbers at all equal.  And that
feeling of strength always makes a people that can feel
it actually stronger.  It helped to make their greatness.
The result of the battle at Platæa had been very doubtful
in the midst of the fight.  The Greeks had been saved
only by the steadfast courage of the Spartans.  But its
conclusion was decisive.  Persia was a real danger to
Greece no more.  On the contrary, it is Greece that we
now find carrying the war into Asia Minor and freeing
those Ionian coast cities from the yoke of Persia.
Perpetual jealousies between the states still prevented
Greece from extending her power far.  The Persian
could still set one combination of states against another.
The wonder only is that, in the midst of their fights
with each other, they were able to engage in schemes
of foreign attack at all.
</p>

<p>
We may be quite sure of one thing, that the Grecian
states never could have stopped the advance of Persia
if it had not been for the marvellous courage and
discipline of the Spartans, and that the Spartans never
could have had this marvellous courage and discipline
if it had not been for the remarkable character of their
institutions and their government.  Their great idea
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P138"></a>138}</span>
was that the individual man or woman did not matter
at all.  What mattered was the state&mdash;that the state
should be powerful, should have good soldiers to defend
it and to attack its enemies.  It was with that purpose
in view that all its laws were made.  The Spartans
lived not for themselves but for the state.  Hardihood,
therefore, and courage were what they aimed at in
themselves and their children, so that the state might
be well served.  The Spartan punishments for offences
against the laws were fearfully severe.  So were the
punishments of children by their parents, and for a
child to cry or utter a sound under such punishment
was regarded as a dreadful disgrace to it.  "Spartan
fortitude" is a proverbial saying even amongst us
to-day.  It was training of this kind which made the
Spartan troops so steadfast in battle and which gave
the Spartans on the whole the leadership over the other
states.
</p>

<p>
It was a very noble idea, very self-sacrificing&mdash;this
of each citizen living not for himself alone but for the
state; but these people were not large-minded enough
to carry the idea a little farther and see that it would
be for the advantage of all Greece if each state could
sacrifice its own interests and good for the sake of the
whole.  They could sacrifice themselves as individuals
for Sparta, but they had no idea of sacrificing Sparta
for Greece.  On the contrary, they were terribly eager
to build up the power of Sparta at the cost of Athens
or of any other state.  They would even ally themselves
with the enemy of all Greece, with Persia, in order to
do so.
</p>

<p>
The other states were equally selfish about their
own state interests, but their individuals had not the
same idea of self-sacrifice for the good of the state;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P139"></a>139}</span>
and therefore their states were not so powerful as
Sparta, nor their soldiers so brave and well disciplined.
</p>

<p>
The Athenians, however, were far more cultivated,
better artists, musicians, orators, writers and so on,
than the Spartans.
</p>

<p>
The most glorious days of Greece, we may say,
reached from 500 B.C. to 350 B.C.  I have made it a
rule in this story to bother you as little as possible
with names, either of places or persons, and only now
and then with dates, because too many names and
figures always seem to me to confuse a story; but I
am going to name now a few of the greatest persons
in these glorious days of Greece because they are the
persons who have been makers of the world's very best
thoughts and best artistic products.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Greek literature
</span>
</p>

<p>
Homer, that great singer, sang&mdash;it is much to be
doubted whether he ever wrote&mdash;-long before this
period.  There were also Sappho, the poetess, and
Alcæus, who wrote in those metres from which we have
named our Sapphics and Alcaics.  These did not come
within the most glorious days.  But in that splendid
time, and inspired no doubt by its splendour, came
Sophocles and Æschylus, writers of the finest tragedies;
there was Euripides, who was a tragic writer for the
stage too, yet has imagined some of his scenes in a lighter
and livelier way than those older and fearfully grim
writers of the drama.  Later came Aristophanes, the
comic dramatist, who brings on birds and frogs as
actors in his plays.  There was the mighty orator,
Demosthenes.  Oratory and speech-making were very
much studied and practised.  Probably there were a
large number of speakers whom even to-day we would
think extraordinarily fine.  There were a host of painters
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P140"></a>140}</span>
and musicians; but we cannot hear their music and
the pictures have perished.
</p>

<p>
Then there was Socrates, the great philosopher, and
Plato, who wrote the dialogues in which Socrates, who
was his master, was the chief speaker.  Socrates
was not a writer.  I suppose we can never know how
much in the dialogues is Plato's and how much
Socrates'.  We may suspect that very much is due to
Plato, though he gives Socrates nearly all the credit.
Later came Aristotle, who wrote about everything&mdash;about
philosophy, about science, about morality,
about natural history, about government.  Plato,
before him, or Socrates speaking to us by Plato's pen,
had been very much interested in the art of
government&mdash;in discussing the best form of government.
But the government which they all discussed was the
government of those small city states which we have
seen in Greece.  They did not concern themselves with
government of large nations and empires.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Sculpture
</span>
</p>

<p>
But almost more glorious than any of these were the
sculptors, of whom the greatest were Phidias and
Praxiteles.  The work of the sculptors was employed
chiefly in connection with the work of the architects,
of the builders of the temples and the public buildings.
The temples were splendidly ornamented with the most
perfect statues and cuttings in marble that man has
ever produced.  The architecture of the Greeks was
more perfect than that of any nation before or since.
We may suppose, as we have seen, that it owed much
to the example of that very fine Minoan art which was
produced in Crete very long before, and which was
carried to the mainland of Greece, and is especially
seen in excavations at Mycenæ.
</p>

<p>
What is most noticeable about the Egyptian, and
also about the Babylonian, architecture of temples and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P141"></a>141}</span>
tombs is their enormous size.  They seem to have tried
to impress the imagination
of men by buildings
of such size that men
going in and out of them
are no bigger than ants,
comparatively.  And they
succeed in being impressive
in this way.  They
are terrifying.  But the
Greek works do not
terrify.  They are works
of pure beauty, and it is
their beauty which still
charms us as no other
work of its kind has ever done.

<br>
CORINTHIAN ARCHITECTURE (MONUMENT OF LYSICRATES).
</p>

<p>
The sculptures, as I
said, are seen chiefly in
what remains of the
temples, and most of the
statues are of gods and
goddesses and heroes
who were supposed to
be super-human; but
although they took those
divine and half-divine
persons as the objects
and models of their art,
the gods and all that had
to do with religion seem
to have been of far less
importance in the lives
of these Greeks than they were in the lives of any of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P142"></a>142}</span>
the people whom we have met in the whole course
of our story.
</p>

<p>
The Egyptians, the Babylonians, the peoples of
Syria and Palestine, and the Persians all were very
much occupied with doing service to their gods, and
some of them regulated their lives very much by doing
what they thought the gods would wish them to do.
With the Greeks, religious ceremonies, or acting as the
gods would have them act, hardly came into their lives at
all.  The persons of Homer's poems pay more attention
to the gods than the Greeks of the later time to which we
have now come.  The former do seem to have had an
idea that the chief of the gods, whom they called Zeus,
living on top of Mount Olympus with inferior gods and
goddesses about him, did interfere with the affairs of
men and did punish men who did not do the divine
will.  But it was a religion that a people so intelligent
as these later Greeks could hardly be expected to believe
in.  They seem to have kept up some pretence of belief,
for it was brought as part of a charge against the great
philosopher Socrates, on which he was actually
condemned to death, that he had spoken impiously of the
gods, but we may suspect that this was only used
against him by enemies who really had as little respect
as he had for such gods as these.
</p>

<p>
At all events, I do not think that we shall be wrong
in saying that these Greeks had no religion at all
which made really any difference in their lives until
Christianity was brought to them by the Jews, and
especially by St. Paul, the great apostle to the
Gentiles&mdash;which means to the peoples that were not of Jewish
race.
</p>

<p>
But they had strong and clear ideas, for all that, of
right and wrong, of justice and so on.  If they believed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P143"></a>143}</span>
at all in a life after death it was of a life so shadowy,
and their idea of it was so vague, that it certainly made
no difference to their life on earth.  The Egyptians
were very careful in preserving their dead, in the form
of mummies.  The Greeks did not treat their dead
with quite so much respect.  They often burned the
bodies, so they had no occasion for immense tombs.
A small vase would contain the ashes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Life of Greek cities
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to try to imagine the way of life of
these people in their city states.  We may suppose them
to have been a people of very busy active minds,
always ready to discuss any new thing, whether it were
in art, in philosophy, or science.  We may imagine
endless discussions going on under the porticoes which
gave them shelter from the hot sun.  "Stoa," these
porticoes or colonnades were called in Greek, and
it is from the people disputing there that we get
the name of the "Stoic" philosophers.  Opposed to
them in dispute would be the "Epicureans," or
disciples of Epicurus.
</p>

<p>
These would be disputing, and pupils listening to
them, imbibing lessons in oratory and philosophy, and
then out in the street might perhaps pass some
important person like Pericles, the great statesman, or
Alcibiades, or Nicias, the admiral.  Any of these
would be followed by a great retinue of friends and
hangers-on and slaves.
</p>

<p>
In another part of the city there would be busy
shops.  Most of the Grecian cities were on the coast;
and there would be the port and ships coming and going.
Then there would be the gymnasia, where the athletes
could be watched, doing exercises, playing games,
throwing the javelin or the discus, wrestling, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Some half of the population of the city would
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P144"></a>144}</span>
probably be slaves, slaves taken in war or by purchase
from their parents in Thrace or other barbarous lands.
There was a great slave market in Athens itself, and
the sea-faring traders and pirates of whom we have
spoken did a little slave-trading among their other
business.  Probably it was seldom that the slaves
were badly treated, and we know that they often were
set free and often had quite a good time even while
they were slaves.  The name "slave" really comes from
Slav.  It is taken from the name of the Slavonic people,
because it was from them that most of the slaves were
taken.  It is not derived from that Latin word
"servus," which is translated "slave," and from which
our "serf"&mdash;the serfs of the Anglo-Saxons&mdash;is taken.
A slave might rise to quite high employment, and it is
curious to think that the large police force in Athens
was at one time composed of more than a thousand
slaves from Scythia, that land of wild tribes even
farther north and east than Thrace.
</p>

<p>
It seems that the disputations and all the business
were very much the affair of the men only.  The women
took hardly any part.  We have spoken of the poetess
Sappho; but this was long before.  It is evident that
the ladies were more important in the Greek society
of Homer's day than they were later.  We read of no
Greek lady of the glorious days as famous in art or
music or literature; and only a very few seem to have
been allowed to give their opinions on philosophy or
politics.  It seems as if they counted for less than they
ought to count.
</p>

<p>
The Greeks were great game-players, especially
great at athletic games; and we must not forget that
though religion appears to have made little difference
in their lives, they were a people who had great respect
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P145"></a>145}</span>
for old customs and were therefore careful to keep up
and perform in proper manner religious ceremonies.
In some of them the women took a part.
</p>

<p>
Even in the very midst of their struggle against the
Persians, the Greek states were only with the greatest
difficulty able to lay aside their jealousy of each other
and to come together to fight; and after that danger
from the east had been dispelled they were free to
fight with each other, or to quarrel about the leadership.
They did fight and quarrel unceasingly for some 150
years.  After the final repulse of the Persians, Athens
for a time gained the leadership, owing to the disgust
of the states at the insolence of the Spartans, who had
been leaders before.  But Sparta was too strong to be
put down easily.  At last a combination of the rest of the
states under the leadership of Thebes fairly conquered
Sparta and took possession of the Spartan territory.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Peloponnesian War
</span>
</p>

<p>
The most famous of this long succession of fights
is that between Sparta on the one side and Athens, as
the leader, on the other.  It is usually called the
Peloponnesian War, the Peloponnese being all that part
of Greece below the Isthmus of Corinth, and it is chiefly
famous because its story has been so wonderfully well
told by Thucydides.
</p>

<p>
Thucydides was a very famous Greek historian.
So, too, was Herodotus, who wrote long before him.
But Herodotus was more of a story-teller.  He was a
traveller who wrote about what he saw; and always
writes truly when he is telling us of what he himself
saw.  He has strange tales to tell, about one-eyed men
and men who carried their heads under one arm, and so
on, which were told him by people whom he met; but
he tells them with a warning that he will not vouch for
them, because he did not see such things himself.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P146"></a>146}</span>
</p>

<p>
But he has no idea of telling us the real reason why
the stories that he tells happened as they did&mdash;the
political causes, as we should say, of the events.  Any
trivial reason seems good enough to him to account for
a great war.  He would have been quite ready to accept
the beautiful lady idea as the reason of the siege of
Troy.
</p>

<p>
Thucydides, on the contrary, looked into the true
reasons of the events.  He, rather than Herodotus, was
the "father of history."  There were other fine Greek
historians, and notably one, Xenophon, who went with
an extraordinary expedition of the Greeks&mdash;-10,000 in
number&mdash;who penetrated, fighting, far into Asia Minor;
and then had to retreat again, still fighting, having
done very little good.  He went and came back with
that expedition and wrote the story of it.
</p>

<p>
But he was not the equal, as historian, of Thucydides,
who wrote of the Peloponnesian War, and who wrote,
further, of wars which the Greeks, especially the
Athenians, had now to carry yet farther afield&mdash;or
oversea&mdash;and not for the first time, to Sicily.
</p>

<p>
And there, in Sicily, there met together Greeks,
Carthaginians, and another people&mdash;of a new name,
not altogether unimportant in the story&mdash;-Latins or
Romans from the neighbourhood of that city established
on the Tiber.
</p>

<p>
The story, which I am now trying to carry down to
the year 330 B.C. or so, has shifted its scene westward.
We have seen how near that island of Sicily lies both
to Europe, by way of the toe of Italy, and to Africa, by
way of Carthage.  It is a kind of bridge or stepping-stone
between the two.  We must see how the nations
met there.

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
THE MEETING OF THE NATIONS ROUND SICILY
</h3>

<p>
Carthage was one of the colonies founded by the
Phœnicians.  It was not one of the earliest, but it had
the advantage of a good harbour for the protection of
the ships of those days.  It grew in importance and in
numbers of inhabitants, so that it soon became the chief
of all the stations of the kind which the Phœnicians
had planted, sending their colonists out from their
native capital cities of Tyre and Sidon.
</p>

<p>
Now Tyre and Sidon were captured by that great
king Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon about a hundred years
or so before the Persian attacks on Greece, and the
effect of that capture of the two capital cities was to
leave Carthage as the most powerful city belonging to
the Phœnicians.  Carthage, then, from that time,
became the capital, the chief city, of this great naval
power.  It was the headquarters of naval power in the
Mediterranean.  Greek colonists from many different
states of Greece had already spread themselves along
the shores of Sicily, and even so far as the shores of
Spain and those Balearic Islands (or islands of the
slingers) where, as we are told, a boy's dinner was
always set up on top of a pole and he was not allowed
to eat it until he had knocked it down with a stone
from his sling.  Naturally, the inhabitants learned to
be good slingers.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P148"></a>148}</span>
</p>

<p>
Now, the Phœnicians were evidently not people of
the kind that are contented to sit still.  They were
energetic, pushing; and of course they came into
conflict with the Greek colonies.  The principal
conflicts took place in, or around, Sicily, where the
Phœnicians, as well as the Greeks, had long been settled.
It was not until Carthage had grown to considerable
power that the Phœnicians could hope to do much
against the Greeks, and about that time some of the
Greek cities also gained strength for military and naval
enterprise by coming into rather closer union with
each other.
</p>

<p>
The constitution of very many of the Greek city
states went through the same succession of changes.
After the rule of the aristocratic party, that is to say, of
the best-born people, who were the rich landowners,
there came a time of rule by the democracy, that is
to say by the poorer, the common people.  This
democratic rule was so disorderly that a strong single
ruler generally arose out of the disorder and established
his power, somewhat as Napoleon I. did out of the
disorder of the French Revolution.  These rulers, or
dictators, were called tyrants in Greece, and the changes
of the constitutions in the government of their colonial
cities in Sicily went on in exactly the same way as in
Greece itself.  A strong ruler established over one city
would often be able to make good his power over
another city near him.  Thus began to be formed
alliances of cities under the rule of one or of a few
leading men; and so the Sicilian Greeks found some
strength of their own to oppose to the strength of
Carthage.
</p>

<p>
Historians tell us of such sweeping successes of the
Phœnicians in the earliest conflicts that if we were to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P149"></a>149}</span>
believe them all we should have to believe that hardly
a Greek was left in Sicily.  But evidently that is not
exactly how it did happen, for it was just while the
Persians were threatening Greece that Gelo, one of the
greatest of the Sicilian "tyrants," established Syracuse
as the capital city of Sicily and the headquarters of his
power.  The Greek colonists had largely assimilated
the native peoples to themselves.  There had been
marriages between them, and Greek thought had
penetrated here as it had everywhere that the Greeks
went.  So the strength of the Greeks in Sicily did not
depend on the colonists.  Only the Greek colonists
seem to have been far more successful in getting help
from the native people than the Phœnician colonists
were.  The Phœnicians, however, had their friends in
Sicily, even among the Greeks themselves, for there
were jealousies between the Greek cities in Sicily as
everywhere else.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Phœnicians defeated
</span>
</p>

<p>
I told you that Xerxes for the safety of his fleet had
made an alliance with Carthage before making his
great attack on Greece.  It was something more than a
mere arrangement that his ships should not be meddled
with as they went to and fro.  It was an agreement for
some more active help than this.  Carthage was to
attack the Greek colonial power in Sicily at the same
time as Xerxes fell upon the mainland of Greece from
the east.  The two attacks were so well timed that it is
said that the battle which decided the result of the
Phœnician expedition against Sicily was fought on the
very same day as the battle of Salamis which decided
the fate of the Persian attack on Greece.  And the
result of the one battle was the same as that of the other.
Gelo completely vanquished the Phœnicians; so completely
that Sicily had rest from their troubling nearly
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P150"></a>150}</span>
all through what remained of that century&mdash;that is to
say, for ninety years or so.
</p>

<p>
During that period the arts and civilisation made
great advance in the cities of Sicily.  Again, as before,
it was really the jealousy and fighting of the Greek
cities among themselves that brought them under
fresh attack by what they called the barbarian power.
Again the Carthaginians came upon them.  They were
disunited, fighting among themselves.  The Athenian
navy had come to Sicily to take its part in the fighting,
as is told in the splendid history of Thucydides.  It
was fighting which all grew out of that Peloponnesian
War which was fought between Athens, as the leading
state in the main part of Greece, on the one side, and
Sparta, as the great power of the Peloponnese, on the
other.  The Syracusans, of Sicily, were originally a
Corinthian colony, from Corinth, on the Isthmus
between the greater part of Greece and the Peloponnese.
The Athenian navy came to Sicily in the year 415 B.C.,
and if it had made a vigorous attack on Syracuse at
its first coming it is probable that the city would have
fallen.  The Athenian admiral, however, delayed; he
allowed the Syracusans time to improve their defences,
and he had to sit down to blockade the city both by land
and sea.  A small Spartan force came to the help of
the besieged, they put all their own naval power into
the struggle, and in the spring of 413 B.C. fought and
defeated the Athenian fleet.
</p>

<p>
They were just in time, for the very next day
strong reinforcements arrived from Athens.  With this
new force the besiegers tried to recover their lost
positions, but were defeated.  The Syracusans then
blocked the mouth of the harbour in which the Athenian
ships lay, and after a final struggle both by land and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P151"></a>151}</span>
sea, the Athenians were hopelessly beaten; those who
survived had a wretched fate as captives.
</p>

<p>
But even after this great defence and complete
victory there were many different and opposing
interests in Sicily.  Sometimes a city which you would
expect to find helping one side, is found fighting on
just the opposite side.  The story of the whole would
be far too long to tell here.  The effect of it all was that
when a new Carthaginian force attacked the Sicilian
Greeks in 409 B.C. the Greeks were weakened and
disunited after all these contentions among themselves.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Dionysius of Syracuse
</span>
</p>

<p>
Again, it was a tyrant of Syracuse, Dionysius, who
drew together the Grecian strength, together with
that of the native Sicilians, but it was not until half
the Greek cities on the island had been lost and their
civilisation destroyed.  It is evident that Dionysius
was a ruler of very much more than common ability.
These tyrants who seized the power in so many of the
Greek states, both at home and in the colonies, did not
generally sit on their thrones very securely or very
long, but Dionysius reigned for no less than thirty-eight
years.  He employed a large number of mercenary
troops, both Greeks and others; he had Sparta as an
ally, and he sustained four invasions of the Carthaginians.
He made alliances with some of the states on
the Italian mainland, and made war on others, till he
became master of much of the southern region of Italy.
But it was for a time only, and the power of Syracuse
was never firmly established on any part of the mainland.
</p>

<p>
After the death of Dionysius there was continual
fighting, for and around Sicily, between the Carthaginians
on the one side and the Sicilian Greeks, with
various and often-changing alliances, on the other.
At one moment we see the Sicilians actually carrying
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P152"></a>152}</span>
the war into Africa, while at the very same moment the
Carthaginians are attacking the Sicilians in Sicily
itself!
</p>

<p>
And so the story goes, a story of continual contests,
with continually changing results, down to 300 B.C. and
later, and gradually we begin to hear more and more of
a certain small, and at first quite insignificant, state in
Italy, namely, Rome, taking part in the contest.  It is
a part that becomes greater and greater as time goes
on till it fills almost every chapter and page.
</p>

<p>
But now that we have traced the story of what was
happening in and about Sicily, and Carthage, and Italy,
down to this date of about 300 B.C., we have to turn back
again, first to Greece itself and then to the eastern side
of the Mediterranean, for tremendous events have
been going on there during the last half-century of this
period.
</p>

<p>
We left it, you will remember, with the Persians
repulsed, no longer a serious danger to Greece, yet the
Greeks themselves unable, because of their own
jealousies and divisions, to make any large conquests in
Asia Minor.  A new power, of over-mastering strength,
suddenly appears in that eastern portion of our
picture&mdash;the power of Macedon.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{<a id="P153"></a>153}</span></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
MACEDON
</h3>

<p>
The country of Macedon, as you will see on the Greek
map, lies northward of Greece.  It was inhabited by
tribes of the Slavs, or Slavonic people, who lived the
agricultural and pastoral life, tilling the soil and having
flocks and herds.  About 100 years after the battle of
Salamis, a baby was born of the royal house of
Macedonia.  He was given the name of Philip.  His
childhood was spent at Thebes, in Greece, where he had
been sent, or had been taken, as a hostage.  When he
came to the throne of Macedon he seems at once to
have begun to strengthen the army, and to improve
its organisation.  He had acquired his ideas of what
an army should be, as we may suppose, while he was
being educated at Thebes.  The Macedonian army was
formed much on the model of the Greek army, but
there were certain differences, and every one of the
differences seems to have been an improvement.
</p>

<p>
There was a phalanx, after the model of the Greek
phalanx, and therein was the great strength of the
infantry.  But the phalanx of the Macedonians was
not quite so closely packed (there was more space
between one soldier and the next) as the Greek phalanx,
and it was able to adopt this more open formation by
means of giving to each soldier a longer spear or pike
than the Greek soldier had.  Thus the Macedonian
phalanx was able to move more quickly than the Greek,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P154"></a>154}</span>
and also could cover more ground with the same number
of men.
</p>

<p>
Now as to the cavalry.  The Greeks, as we saw,
were not nearly so well off as the Persians for horses.
They had not the unlimited extent of horse-raising
country that the Persians had in the lands towards the
east.  But the Macedonians, on the contrary, were almost
as well off in this way as the Persians themselves.  Away
back in Thrace and Scythia they had these unlimited
extents, so their cavalry became a very strong force.
</p>

<p>
And the same lands which provided them with
horses provided them with soldiers also.  Philip began
to use his great strength of arms by making himself
master of the countries on all sides of the kingdom
of Macedon, to which he had succeeded.  There were
many Greek colonies or small cities along the coast of
Macedonia itself.  These he took possession of with
little trouble.  Certain of the Greeks at home began
to be alarmed by the growth of this power in the
north.  You may have heard of some famous orations
called "Philippics," delivered by the great orator
Demosthenes, at Athens.  Their name comes from this
very Philip of Macedon, because it was in the hope of
rousing the Athenians to take strong measures, and to
unite with other states to oppose his power, that they
were made.
</p>

<p>
But, as usual, there were jealousies.  Athens did at
length combine with Thebes to oppose Philip, but by
that time he had found allies in Greece itself.  He
marched south, met the Thebans and Athenians at
Chæronea, in 338 B.C., and won a battle which makes a
very great difference in our story, for it was so decisive
that it practically put an end, once for all, to the
independence of Greece.  Greece for many years had to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P155"></a>155}</span>
do what Macedonia ordered.  Philip was given, or
assumed, command of all the Greek armies, with a
title which has been translated
"Captain-General."  Commander-in-Chief might describe it nearly as well,
and is a title better known to us.
</p>

<p>
And now, for the first time, we have a really united
Greece.  But though a united Greece, it was not a
free Greece.  It was united because it was under the
masterful rule of the Macedonians.
</p>

<p>
But, being united, and joined moreover with the
forces of the Macedonians and their allies it probably
was the greatest fighting force the world had yet known.
There was one direction in particular in which it was
likely that it would make its force felt&mdash;against Persia.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Alexander the Great
</span>
</p>

<p>
In the midst of the preparation for the invasion
of the Persian empire, Philip was assassinated, after
reigning for twenty-three years, and was succeeded by
his son Alexander&mdash;Alexander the Great&mdash;then only
twenty years old.  And Alexander the Great died only
twelve years later.  He was therefore only thirty-two
years old at his death.  Yet he had time to win the
name of Great; and when you hear his story you will
think that it was well deserved, for the story is
extraordinary.
</p>

<p>
It is extraordinary by reason of the immense extent
of territory over which Alexander went victoriously
and with marvellous rapidity.  But the explanation
is not very far to seek&mdash;it lies in that very powerful
army and fighting machine which had been delivered
to him by his father; in that, and in the lack of
resisting power in the enemies whom it overcame, is
the explanation of his success.
</p>

<p>
The fighting power of the Persian empire had spent
itself; and partly it had spent itself in the destruction
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P156"></a>156}</span>
of the fighting power of the nations with which it had
come into touch.  In that, as it seems, taken together
with the very real strength of Alexander's army, lies
the explanation.  The Persian power, moreover, apart
from its loss in actual fighting, had probably lost much
by life in conditions more easy and pleasant than those
in the more rugged and barren country from which
Cyrus had led the Persians.  We have noticed the same
change in the character of conquering nations already,
and may see it yet again in course of the great story.
</p>

<p>
As for this particular story which we are telling at
the moment, about Alexander and the march of his
ever-victorious army, it will be a short story although such a
marvellous one.  It is short, just because the march had
scarcely a stopping-place, scarcely a check, all through.
</p>

<p>
This Alexander, succeeding to the throne of Macedonia
and to all that his father Philip had made of that
throne, and to the command-in-chief of the great army
which Philip had created, had been educated by
perhaps the most wonderful man of that wonderful
Greek nation&mdash;the philosopher Aristotle.  We call him
philosopher, but there was no branch of the learning of
that time, and it was a time of great learning, which he
does not seem to have known perfectly.  The additions
that he made to every branch of that learning are most
astonishing.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br>
ALEXANDER THE GREAT. <br>
(From the British Museum.)
</p>

<p>
We have to look on this young Alexander, then, as
being as perfectly trained and taught as it was possible
for a young man to be, and as having come into his
kingdom with this great army ready to start, with all
its plans laid, for the Persian invasion.  Let us see
what use he made of it.  We know its composition&mdash;a
certain number of Macedonian native soldiers, Greek
and other allies; and we know its general way of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P157"></a>157}</span>
fighting, with the quickly moving Macedonian phalanx,
armed with the long pikes, and the hosts of cavalry
on good horses.  But he was a very young king.  The
Greeks seem to have thought they had a chance, on his
accession, of freeing themselves from the Macedonian
yoke.  Even in his own kingdom there was trouble,
and some of the tribes in the north rose in revolt.
Alexander crushed all these various attempts against
his power.  Twice he had to march south, to Thebes,
that city where he had been as a boy.  Once it
admitted him at the head of his army without a fight,
but on the second occasion, when it had taken arms
again against Macedon on hearing a false rumour
that Alexander had been killed in some fighting in the
north, he came down and razed the city walls and
punished the inhabitants with fearful severity.
</p>

<p>
These home troubles occupied two years of his
reign, and in the third year he crossed the Hellespont
with his great army and had his first big meeting with
the Persian forces on the river Granicus.  He was
completely victorious.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Battle of Issus
</span>
</p>

<p>
But Darius, the Persian monarch, still claiming the
title of King of Kings, was not likely to be content with
the result of a single battle.  He gathered his strength
anew, and again met Alexander in the following year,
at Issus, in Syria.  This time his defeat was even more
decisive than before.
</p>

<p>
Alexander advanced southward conquering.  He
took all the Phœnician cities of the coast, though
Tyre made an obstinate defence, and swept down into
Egypt.  Egypt appears to have made no attempt&mdash;perhaps
it had little wish&mdash;to resist him.  By this time
there were many Greeks in Egypt, and it is likely that
they would receive the forces of the Macedonians,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P158"></a>158}</span>
among which were many of their kinsmen, almost more
as friends than foes.  The city of Alexandria, founded
by him, or in his honour, takes its name from him.
</p>

<p>
The Persians, however, were not yet done with.  By
321 B.C., two years after his defeat at Issus, Darius had
collected an army greater than ever before, and
Alexander, coming eastward out of Egypt, met this
vast host, said to have been a million strong, at
Gaugemela, or Arbela, and in this third and last conflict
his victory was decisive.  Darius fled eastward, with
Alexander constantly in pursuit of him.  Alexander
took the great cities of Babylon and Susa on his way.
The fugitive Darius was assassinated in Parthia, and
Alexander's lordship over the ancient empire was
complete.
</p>

<p>
Yet that was not enough for him.  He pushed
forward into India, across high mountain ranges and
wide rivers.  What he accomplished there, in the way
of conquest, was marvellous, yet it had no big effect on
the great story, because his conquests beyond the
mountains were not lasting.  His wonderful troops,
though they must have looked on him as almost supernatural
in his ability to lead them on to victory, began
to long for their homes, probably to wonder if they
would ever see them again after coming so far.  He
reached the shores of the Indian Ocean, and thence
set his face to return homeward.
</p>

<p>
In Babylonia he stayed awhile, arranging for the
government of the immense empire of which he was
the undisputed master, and there he died, of a fever
which is said to have been brought on, or greatly
increased, by intemperate drinking&mdash;a death unworthy
of his extraordinary achievements and of a pupil of
such a master as Aristotle.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P159"></a>159}</span>
</p>

<p>
And death at thirty-two!  The exploits of
Alexander and his army are unequalled in the whole
course of the story of the world.  Yet we must ever
remember how much of that immense achievement
was due to the genius of his father Philip, who created
all the fighting force which the son led so triumphantly.
The fame of the son is so glorious that the father's
work is rather hidden by it.  What Philip might have
done, if he had lived, with the great machine of war
which he devised we cannot tell, but it is sure that
Alexander could not have achieved his conquests as he
did but for the machinery which his father had made
ready for him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Death of Alexander
</span>
</p>

<p>
No doubt death came for the great conqueror
quite unexpectedly in his thirty-third year, and he
had made no arrangements as to who was to be his
successor on the throne of the vast empire that he had
won.  There was no lack of claimants for it.  Many of
his victorious generals were willing enough, and there
was much confused fighting among the victors and the
forces under the command of each.  One of the
principal generals, Ptolemæus, or Ptolemy, was the
commander of the armies that held Egypt.  In Babylonia
and Syria it appears that there was a period of
rivalry and struggle between several of the leading
generals, until at length one of them, Seleucus,
prevailed over the rest, and he claimed to be, and in large
measure really was, ruler of Syria and of the East as
Ptolemy was ruler of Egypt.  The proud title of King
of Kings, which the Persian monarchs had assumed,
now came to nothing, seeing that there were at least
two kings now in this eastern part of the world.
Seleucus and his successors, called the Seleucidæ,
became established as Kings of Syria, in its new
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P160"></a>160}</span>
capital city of Antioch; and Ptolemy and his successors,
called the Ptolemies, became no less firmly seated on
the throne of the ancient Pharaohs in Egypt.
</p>

<p>
Others of Alexander's generals who became rulers
of one or other part of his empire after his death were
Antigonus, Lysimachus, and Cassander.  Cassander
was son of Antipater, whom Alexander had left as his
regent in Macedonia to govern the country for him
when he went on his wars against the Persians.  All
these generals and their followers continued fighting,
with various results, until the great and decisive battle
at Ipsus (not Issus), of which the practical result was
that Cassander was established as king of Macedonia
and Greece.  The battle of Ipsus was fought in 301 B.C.,
twenty-two years later than the battle of Issus.
Seleucus and Lysimachus were the victorious leaders
over Antigonus, who was killed during the fight in this
battle of Ipsus; and to Lysimachus had already been
assigned the kingdom of Thrace.
</p>

<p>
So now, in 300 B.C., we have Cassander over Macedonia
and Greece, Lysimachus over Thrace, Seleucus
over Syria and Babylonia, and Ptolemy over Egypt.
That is the condition of affairs at that date on this
eastern side of the picture.  But it had not been
brought about without some sharp fighting between
Seleucus and Ptolemy, and here, as before, Palestine
was like the horseshoe between the blacksmith's
hammer and his anvil.  It lay right in the path between
the two great combatants.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Jews in Egypt
</span>
</p>

<p>
Alexander, when he went conquering, with little or
no opposition, into Egypt, had shown much favour to
the Jews.  We have seen that many of them had
returned, under favour of Cyrus the Persian, from their
Babylonian exile, to Jerusalem.  The temple had been
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P161"></a>161}</span>
rebuilt, not without a good deal of interference from
their Syrian neighbours; the religious rites had been
re-instituted and were strictly observed.
</p>

<p>
Alexander, it appears, showed consideration to the
Jews in Jerusalem.  He was, we may presume, a
Greek in his religious views&mdash;that is to say, that religion
made very little difference and had very little part in
his life.  He would not care what god a subject people
liked to worship, so long as they did not oppose him.
He took some of the Jews down with him, or had them
brought, into Egypt, where there were already some of
their nation, and they were given quarters of their own
and a synagogue, or place of assembly and worship, in
the new city of Alexandria.  So here we have yet
another step in that dispersion of the Jews which was
to bring their religion, on which Christianity is founded,
into all parts of the world.
</p>

<p>
I mentioned too that, rather as the Jewish religion
became known throughout the world by the dispersion
of those who followed it, so also did the thought and
culture of the Greeks become known by the way in
which that wonderful people was spread abroad.  I
have been writing of Macedonians hitherto as though
they were a people altogether different from the
Greeks, and so in truth, and in origin, they were.  But
I want you to realise that though they conquered
Greece by their force of arms, it was (as always happened
whenever Greeks met people of other nationality) the
Greek thought that conquered their thought.  They
began more and more to think in the Greek way.
Moreover, their very armies were largely Greek.
</p>

<p>
Thus it came to pass, in course of time, that the
distinction between Macedonian and Greek began to be
lost.  After all, Macedon was a very near neighbour
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P162"></a>162}</span>
of Greece herself.  There must have been much coming
and going between the two.  Therefore the "Hellenising"
of the world, as you may read it described&mdash;which
means making the thought of the world like the
thought of Hellas, which is another name for Greece&mdash;went
on very fast and was spread abroad very widely.
There is no part of that world which is the scene of our
great story which it had not reached and in which it
had not made a considerable difference in the lives of
the inhabitants.  Over a large part of it Greek had
become the language in use among the better-educated
classes.  Seleucus was particularly active in
introducing Greeks and Greek customs into the kingdom
under his rule.
</p>

<p>
The possession of Palestine, inevitably, because of
its position, had been very much disputed between
Seleucus and Ptolemy after Alexander's death, but the
dispute was decided by the battle of Ipsus, which
seems to have cleared the air all round.  Palestine
then became subject to Egypt and so remained under
successive Ptolemies for more than a hundred years.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Alexandria
</span>
</p>

<p>
The Jews in Judæa, with that love of their own
customs which has always been remarkably strong in
their nation, held out against the introduction of Greek
thought and language, and so on, longer than any of
their neighbours, but many Jews, as we have seen, had
settled in Alexandria.  The first three, at least, of the
Ptolemies, who successively reigned in Egypt, showed
favour to them; they had synagogues in other cities
of Egypt besides Alexandria, and those Jews of Egypt,
besides those who were in Babylonia and other parts
of Asia, had the habit of coming up to Jerusalem, where
was the Temple, to attend their great religious
ceremonies.  And these Jews brought to Jerusalem the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P163"></a>163}</span>
Greek language and thought, so that the Greek influence
penetrated there too at last.
</p>

<p>
Alexandria became a great city for men of letters,
learned men and writers, as well a great city of trade
and a great seaport.  The largest library of the ancient
world was collected&mdash;and later was destroyed by fire&mdash;in
that city.  And there, probably before 250 B.C., the
books of the Old Testament, originally written in
Hebrew, were translated into Greek.  Possibly not all
were translated at that time, but it seems at least
certain that the first five books, called the Pentateuch,
were done into Greek about that date.  Wherever
they went the Jews never lost sight of their sacred
books.  The records of their history and their religious
institutions were always with them.
</p>

<p>
Under the later kings of the Ptolemaic dynasty
the government of Egypt was less strongly maintained,
the power of Egypt waned, and in 198 B.C. the
Egyptians were thoroughly defeated by the Syrians on
the banks of the Jordan, and Judæa and Jerusalem
came under the rule of the Syrian king.  He did not
interfere with their religion or their customs, and for a
while the change of rulers appears to have made very
little difference to them.
</p>

<p>
Such, then, is the outline which I would have you
carry in your minds of the position of those peoples of
the story on the eastern side of the Mediterranean, in
Egypt southward, and in Thrace, Macedon, and Greece.
And now I would ask you to come back again to look
at the western side of the picture, for the time has
fully come when we should bring more prominently into
it a figure which will grow larger and larger until it grows
to such a size as to fill in the whole frame, and more
than the frame&mdash;the figure of world-conquering Rome.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
ROME AND CARTHAGE
</h3>

<p>
I am afraid you will have suffered disappointment from
time to time in the course of the telling of this greatest
of great stories.  I am afraid that I have been obliged
to speak rather slightingly of that beautiful lady for
whose sake you will have heard that the Trojan War
was fought, the lady about whom Homer sang.  I
have made my excuses for that disrespectful treatment.
</p>

<p>
There is another famous lady of whom Virgil, the
great Latin poet, sings&mdash;Queen Dido, of Carthage.
His story goes that Æneas, the Trojan, escaping
over-sea after the fall of Troy, was swept by storms into
Carthage, where Dido entertained him pleasantly.
From her court he went to Italy, and from him the
Romans were said to be descended.  The Æneid&mdash;that
is, the story of Æneas&mdash;is the name of Virgil's poem in
which this tale is told.  You may believe as much or as
little of it as you like, for there is no evidence at all that
it is true; but it is a fine tale, finely told.
</p>

<p>
Then there is the story about Romulus and Remus
and the good old wolf-mother, and the rest of it&mdash;all
very pleasant too.  But I do not think that you need
believe any more of that either than you like.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Gauls in Rome
</span>
</p>

<p>
They are not very ancient stories, nothing like as
old as some of the stories about Egypt and Babylonia
for which there is plenty of evidence.  A thousand
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P165"></a>165}</span>
years or so B.C. could cover them all.  Yet for what
was really going on round about what came to be called
Rome we have very little evidence until a great deal
later.  One other pretty tale certainly has some truth
in it&mdash;the story that the Gauls came down upon Rome,
and that the Capitol, or strong citadel, on which the
sentries must have gone to sleep, was only saved by the
alarm being given by some geese.  There may be some
doubt as to whether the geese really were there, and
were the city's saviours, for it is possible that this too,
like other tales, may have seemed to the poets to be a
pretty story to tell, and they may have told it to please
their hearers without inquiring closely into its truth;
but however it may have been about the geese, there is
no doubt at all about the Gauls.  They were there,
and in terrible numbers, and they only consented to go
away on being bribed to do so with an immense sum of
money.  So it is not a very dignified appearance that
this great Rome makes on her first appearance in our
story&mdash;saved from Gauls, in the first instance, by geese,
and in the second place by bribes!  This happened in
390 B.C.
</p>

<br>
GALLIC WARRIORS. <br>
(From the British Museum.)
</p>

<p>
By Gaul we generally understand France&mdash;the
Gallic, or Gaulic nation.  But Gaul at that time was
the name of the country not only of what we now call
France, but of a great deal of the north of what we call
Italy.  So the Gauls had not very far to come to reach
Rome.  Although the Capitol, the citadel, was saved
from the Gauls at this time, the Gauls destroyed the
city completely, and after their retirement the Romans
set about its rebuilding.
</p>

<p>
You will see, of course, that I have only told you, so
far, who the Romans were not.  I have not told you
who they were.  But I have a very good reason for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P166"></a>166}</span>
that.  I have not told you, and I am not going to tell
you, because I do not know.
</p>

<p>
Rome has been called the City of the Seven Hills,
because it is built on those seven hills which stand
above the River Tiber that runs out westward into the
Mediterranean Sea.  What we do know is that peoples
from the neighbouring country came and settled themselves
on one or other of these hills.  They were peoples
of different origins.  The most civilised, in the earliest
days of this settlement, were from the district called
Etruria.  They were Etruscans.  The Sabines were
another of these peoples.  And there were Latins from
Latium, in which district Rome itself was situated.
</p>

<p>
These peoples became united into one state under
rulers of the Latin race, and that, in very few words,
appears to have been the origin of the Roman nation.
The Etruscans seem at first to have been pushed off the
hills into the plains by the others, and there was
frequent fighting between the plain people and the hill
people.  For their protection from the attacks from
the plains, the early kings of Rome built walls round
the seven hills; but the Etruscans, though they had
given way at first to the Latins and Sabines, must have
come back as conquerors.  They were a powerful
people.  They imposed their own kings upon the
Romans, and Romans and Etruscans together became
the strongest nation in the country.
</p>

<p>
Probably the Romans never were satisfied with their
Etruscan kings, who seem to have governed with great
severity.  More than a hundred years before the Gauls
came upon them, which was in 390 B.C., they successfully
rebelled, drove out the kings and set up a republic.
The Etruscans strove to restore them, and the struggle
went on until a very important victory was gained by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P167"></a>167}</span>
the Roman republican armies at Veii.  The Romans
had never been so strong in Italy before, and although
the attack of the Gauls threatened them with destruction
only six years later, those barbarians, after a seven
months' siege of the Capitol, went back and made no
attempt at establishing their power permanently.  The
Romans rebuilt their walls and their houses.  They
were engaged in almost perpetual fighting with other
peoples, of whom we should notice particularly the
Samnites, in one or other part of Italy.  Now and
again they met with reverses, but on the whole they
prevailed and extended their authority over the
countries that they conquered.  The aid of the Romans
was sought by now one and now another people who
found themselves pressed by hostile neighbours; and
the help was given in consideration that those who were
helped should regard their helper for ever after as their
master.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Pyrrhus
</span>
</p>

<p>
It was a little later than 300 B.C. that the Greek
city states established along the southern shores of
Italy found themselves bothered by the attacks of
some inland neighbours and called for the aid of Rome.
There was one of these cities, however, and the most
important, which repelled the assistance of the Roman
Republic, jealous of her growing power.  This was
Tarentum.  And just at the moment when the struggle
between the Roman forces and this Greek city, which
must inevitably have ended in the defeat of the Greeks,
was about to commence, Tarentum found a new ally
in Pyrrhus, the king of Epirus.
</p>

<p>
Epirus, as you may see, is the north-western region
of Greece, and the nearest to Italy.  Pyrrhus had allied
himself by marriage with Ptolemy of Egypt and had
made a great effort to gain the throne of Macedonia,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P168"></a>168}</span>
but was defeated in that attempt and had to content
himself awhile with being king of his own little country
of Epirus.  It was then that there came to him, and
was welcomed by him, a call to their assistance by
the people of Tarentum menaced by the Roman
armies.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Pyrrhic victories
</span>
</p>

<p>
Pyrrhus marched into Italy with a force that was
strong in cavalry and also in elephants.  The elephants
seem to have terrified the Romans, and Pyrrhus won
several victories.  But though he won victories it was
always at so great a cost to his own force that the
phrase "a Pyrrhic victory," which you may have heard,
is taken even now to mean a victory in which the victor
loses more heavily than the vanquished.
</p>

<p>
We are now, I would have you see, at a point of
some particular interest in the great story, for it is the
first time that Greek and Roman have been facing each
other and fighting each other in any large force and as
nation against nation.
</p>

<p>
Pyrrhus, after his victories, called on Rome to
surrender.  His army was then on the Roman territory
of Latium.  Rome replied that she would hold no
parley with a foe as long as any of his troops were on
her soil.  It was a proud reply, worthy of her future
greatness, to a victorious enemy at her very gates;
but she had formed a strong confederation of several
states that acknowledged her as their sovereign and was
still formidable.  Pyrrhus won another victory, but
again gained little by it, and finding that his project
did not prosper in Italy itself he went over to Sicily.
</p>

<p>
He came to that island on the invitation of the
Greek city states there, who wished his help to rid
them of the Carthaginians, but here again, although he
won victories, he could not establish his power.  He
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P169"></a>169}</span>
made himself thoroughly unpopular with the Greeks,
who had called him in, by the despotic manner in which
he tried to lord it over them, and, what was still worse
for him, his attacks on the Carthaginians drove them
to make an alliance with the Romans against him.  A
result of that alliance was that when, after three years
of unproductive fighting in Sicily, he went back to the
mainland of Italy, his fleet was attacked and severely
handled by the Carthaginians.  He fought one more
battle against the Romans and their confederates, in
Italy, but he did not receive much support from the
Tarentines or any of the Italian-Greek cities.  This
time it was not even a "Pyrrhic victory" for him, but
a decisive defeat, and he went back to his native Epirus
after a six years' absence.  He was killed some years
later in a political revolution in Greece.
</p>

<p>
The total result of the enterprise of Pyrrhus was to
establish Rome more firmly than ever as the mistress
state of Italy, and to bring her into alliance, which was
very soon to be broken, with the great sea-power of the
Carthaginians.
</p>

<p>
The story of Rome herself, within the city walls,
during all the years from the expulsion of the Etruscan
kings down to the date, about 280 B.C., to which we
have now come, was one of perpetual struggle between
the patricians, the aristocratic party, and the plebs,
the party of the people, the populace.  The patricians
had all the power after the first driving out of the
Tarquins, as the Etruscan kings were called, because
they had been the chief managers of the revolution
against them, but all through the later years the
populace grew in power, and took the power out of the
hands of the patricians.  The constitution of the state
became, as we should say, more and more democratic.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P170"></a>170}</span>
The power fell more and more into the hands of the
"demos," the plebeians, the common people.
</p>

<p>
The Romans, as you saw, had made an alliance with
the Carthaginians at the time of the invasion of Italy
and Sicily by Pyrrhus; but it was a friendship that
lasted only a very short while.  Our story is now
coming to a point at which it will be very largely
occupied by wars between these two nations who are
now, for the moment, friends.  The Romans continually
accused the Carthaginians of treachery and of broken
faith.  The Roman name for the Carthaginians was
"Punici," which is somehow derived from the name,
Phœnicia, of the country from which, as you know, the
colony of Carthage was founded.  So bitterly did the
Romans resent their acts of treachery that the words
"Punica fides," that is to say, Punic, or Carthaginian,
faith, were used as a kind of proverb to express a faith
or fidelity which was no faith at all&mdash;a promise made
only to be broken.  Probably they were not very true
to their engagements; they were a very bold, enterprising
people, wonderful sailors, considering the ships
that they had.  They went round Africa, they planted
colonies all along the shores of Spain, they went to the
Cassiterides, or tin islands, which are said to have been
our own British islands.  It is a marvellous record of
adventure.
</p>

<p>
But they do not seem to have been as highly
civilised as the Romans, who had been very largely
influenced by this time by that civilisation and culture
of Greece which we have seen spreading itself very
widely.  Greece had some influence even with them,
for among the temples for the worship of those gods
Baal and Astaroth, which they had brought with
them from Phœnicia, was a temple to the Greek god
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P171"></a>171}</span>
Apollo.  But in thinking over the whole story of the
intercourse and the fighting between Rome and Carthage
we ought to remember that it is almost entirely
from the Roman point of view that we have the story
told.  We do not know much of what the Carthaginians
might have had to say about the Romans.  They
might perhaps have said something about broken faith
on the Roman side also.  It is likely that neither party
was very particular about keeping promises which it
was more convenient not to keep.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
First Punic war
</span>
</p>

<p>
However that may be, it was almost inevitable
that trouble must break out between them before
long; for here was the great and growing land power
of Rome on the northern side of the Mediterranean
stretching down the long leg of Italy; here was Carthage,
with its powerful navy, its determined sailors, and its
adventurous courage, on the southern shore; and there
was Sicily, supposed to be independent of both, lying
like a football just at the very toe of Italy, ready to be
kicked, and reaching nearly over to the Carthaginian
coast.  It was an unfortunate position for that island,
and may remind us of the position of Palestine as the
bridge between the great ancient empires of Egypt and
Babylonia.  There is this difference between the
positions of the two, that the fighting round about
Sicily was sure to be largely naval, an affair of
sea-fights.  It was not so in Palestine.
</p>

<p>
Pyrrhus was driven back home to Epirus out of
Italy in 275 B.C.  In 268 B.C., only seven years later,
began the first of those great struggles between Rome
and Carthage which are known as the Punic Wars.
There were three of these wars, interrupted by truces
which&mdash;owing, as the Romans said, to the infamous
"Punica fides"&mdash;never were lasting.  The true reason
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P172"></a>172}</span>
doubtless was that both powers were too masterful in
character to endure a rival.  One or other had to have
the upper hand.  There were times in the struggle
when it looked very doubtful indeed which would
have it.
</p>

<p>
Sicily was of great importance to the Romans,
because they depended much on the supply of corn
which it gave them.  That was another reason, besides
the reason of its position as a kind of bridge or
stepping-stone between the two great rivals, why it became their
battle-field.  If the Carthaginians could get Sicily,
they could cut off much of the enemy's food supply.
The Romans, for their own preservation, had to make
sure of Sicily.  It was over the possession of Sicily that
this first Punic war broke out.
</p>

<p>
The Romans had gradually made their fleet stronger
and stronger until they were powerful enough to risk a
sea battle with the great naval forces of Carthage, and
they twice met and beat the navies of Carthage, once
in 260 B.C. and again four years later.  Thus, having
command of the sea, they ventured to send an army
into Africa, against Carthage itself, but there they
suffered a very heavy defeat and their general was
taken captive.  The Carthaginians were much aided
in this victory by Spartan mercenaries.  But the fate
of Sicily, where there were both Roman and
Carthaginian armies, remained to be decided.  The war
went on, with varying results, in and around that
unfortunate island, with now the one nation and now
the other gaining a victory, until a decision was at
length reached by a great victory of the Romans in
241 B.C.  This war had lasted twenty-seven years.
</p>

<p>
And here we may note a point in which Rome
seems to have been like our own country, of which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P173"></a>173}</span>
Napoleon I. complained that she always won "the
last battle of a war."  Many times we see her very
hardly pressed, with the enemy at the gates of the city;
but she goes on fighting and she wins the last battle,
the battle which counts and which settles the result in
her favour.
</p>

<p>
This was more particularly so in the Second Punic
War, which began in 219 B.C.
</p>

<p>
Carthage had very great trouble with her own
mercenary troops at the end of the first war against
Rome; they demanded their pay, which was long
overdue.  That matter was largely settled by such
heavy fighting between them and the Carthaginians
themselves that comparatively few of the mercenaries
were left alive at the end of it to receive pay, if there
had been any for them.
</p>

<p>
In the years that followed, Carthage became rich
and prosperous.  She had a large trade with the
interior of Africa as well as with all the coast cities
round the Mediterranean.  She worked mines in Spain,
and in order to draw more wealth from that rich and
fertile country she gradually made herself mistress of a
great part of it, and it was the capture by Carthage of
Saguntum, a city in southern Spain, which was in the
Roman alliance, that led to the outbreak in 219 B.C. of
the Second Punic War.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Hannibal
</span>
</p>

<p>
The Carthaginian general who captured Saguntum,
and thus provoked this greatest of the three Punic Wars,
was Hannibal, perhaps the most famous leader of armies
in all history.
</p>

<p>
In telling this story of the world in mere outline, as
I am trying to tell it, it is impossible to speak of any of
the details of his extraordinary campaign.  He had his
army there in southern Spain.  He marched with it,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P174"></a>174}</span>
meeting no very serious opposition, through Spain into
that northern part of Italy which was then part of
Gaul, and he thence descended into southern Italy
and into the very heart of the Roman country itself.
He won three great victories over the Roman armies on
the way, and finally, a fourth, at Cannæ, in the autumn
of 216 B.C., three years after he set out from Spain; and
after Cannæ Rome herself seemed to
lie at his mercy.

<br>

</p>

<p>
Why he did not at once press on
and lay siege to the city is one of the
puzzles of history.  His army had been
continuously marching and fighting;
he may have thought that it needed
rest.  Almost certainly he expected
further forces to be sent him from
Carthage.  But these forces did not come.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Battle of Zama
</span>
</p>

<p>
There were several rival parties
in Carthage itself, and it seems
likely that there was jealousy of Hannibal's great
successes.  Whatever the reason, the help he expected
was very long in coming.  He stayed on in Italy with
his army which had been so victorious.  The Romans
would not come to another fixed battle with him, but
they hovered about his army, continually harassing it.
Probably it lost much of its fighting force in this
time of waiting.  It was not until nine years after
Cannæ that Hannibal's brother, Hasdrubal, was sent
with an army to his help, and by that time the Romans
had so recovered their strength that they met and
defeated, on the Metaurus, this army of Hasdrubal's;
and it was really this great battle that settled the war.
It left Hannibal helpless for any big fighting in Italy.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P175"></a>175}</span>
It left the Romans free to make their power firm again
in Spain.  They were so little troubled by the presence
of Hannibal, in his present condition, in Italy, that they
again sent a force oversea into Africa.  This time their
arms were completely successful over the Carthaginians
and their African allies.  The Carthaginians, in their
alarm, recalled Hannibal, to see if his genius could
save them.  But it was too late.  He was defeated in
the battle of Zama, in 202 B.C., and therewith came the
end of the Second Punic War.
</p>

<p>
Really it was the end of Carthage as a formidable
rival to the power of Rome.  In the arrangements
which followed she was compelled to give up her fleet,
to give up all her claims on Spain, and on the islands
in the Mediterranean, and to be content with her
possessions in Africa itself.
</p>

<p>
Again, Rome had won the last battle.
</p>

<p>
Why she did not meet her doom after Cannæ, we
can never know.  Had Hannibal pressed forward after
that victory the whole course of the great story would
probably have been quite different.  To what extent
the hand of Providence interferes at such moments of
the story as these we cannot tell&mdash;or to what extent
man is allowed to work out his own fortunes without
that correcting hand.  Undoubtedly there are certain
moments when it looks very much as if Providence
had actively intervened; and perhaps, in our ignorance,
we had better not attempt to say more than that.
</p>

<p>
For more than fifty years, Rome had no trouble
from Carthage, nor can she really have been very
seriously troubled when, in 149 B.C., she declared the
Third Punic War.  Carthage had existed during that
half-century as an opulent and large city.  She had
made alliance with some of the African peoples.  There
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P176"></a>176}</span>
were certain of the Romans who deemed her power
dangerous.  A pretext for a quarrel was easily found.
Rome had now become so powerful that there was no
question as to where the battle-fields of this war would
be.  There was no prospect of a Punic force in Italy
or Sicily.  The war, which began in 149, lasted for three
years, for the Carthaginians within their walls made a
desperate resistance which was worthy of their splendid
history; but at the last they had to yield.  No mercy
was shown; the city was destroyed.  Carthage ceased
to exist.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
ROME AT HOME AND IN THE EAST
</h3>

<p>
As we have seen, there was a moment in the Second
Punic War, just after the Battle of Cannæ, when it
seems marvellous that Rome escaped destruction.
What is almost more marvellous still is that it was
just during the same time that she was fighting so hard,
and in the end so victoriously, against the Carthaginians
that she was able to fight and to extend her power
towards the East, over Macedon, Greece, Asia Minor,
Syria, and Egypt.  It is an extent of conquest which
must seem most marvellous of all when we consider
how quickly it was all done.  It is only a few pages back
that we have seen her coming into the great story at
all, as an actor of any importance, and now she begins
to take such a masterful part in it that all the rest
become of little account when compared with her.
</p>

<p>
How did that happen?  We may be very sure that
it could never have happened unless those Romans had
been very uncommon people, unless they had possessed
great courage and determination, and unless they had
devised a very excellent form of government, both for
themselves and also for the nations over whom their
armies and their fleet got the mastery.  The fighting
forces had to be of splendid qualities in order to win
that mastery, but the government had to be wonderfully
wise in order to keep it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P178"></a>178}</span>
</p>

<p>
It is a point that you should notice particularly,
that all through the story of Rome, even from those
days when the story is really so little known that you
need not believe much more of it than you like&mdash;from
the days of Romulus and Remus and of the mother-wolf&mdash;we
are told that Romulus himself appointed a
body of men called the Senate to manage the affairs
of the city.  What I want you to notice is that the
name Senate comes from the Latin word "senex,"
meaning an old man.  This governing assembly was
an assembly of the old men, and they were thought
likely to be the best rulers because they had lived long
in the world and had been learning the lessons that
it had to teach them longer than younger men.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Senate
</span>
</p>

<p>
All through their story, down to a later date than
that to which we have followed it, they paid very
much reverence to old age.  The power of the father
was very great over his children, and the authority of
the mother was looked up to only a little less than his.
The children were thus brought up in the habit of
obedience to their parents, and there is not the least
doubt that this habit must have helped them to
be obedient to military discipline when they had to
go out and fight.
</p>

<p>
Even after their fathers had died they had a great
reverence for their memory, and this reverence made
them try to be worthy sons of their fathers and to
rival them in fine actions, in showing courage and so
on.  And this same feeling made them very respectful
of all the customs that their fathers had followed.
The custom of their ancestors was the custom that
they thought they ought to follow.  Religion, in the
sense of expecting a reward or punishment from the
gods, whether for good or for bad deeds, does not seem
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P179"></a>179}</span>
to have counted for much in their lives, but this idea,
of living in a manner of which their ancestors would
have approved, to some extent took the place of
religion.  It made fine men and women of them,
ready to fight their best for the state and to die
for it.
</p>

<p>
I do not mean that the Senate was chosen by
Romulus really of the hundred oldest men in his city&mdash;a
hundred is said to have been its number at first, but it
increased to many times a hundred as time went on&mdash;but
it would have been made up of men of age and
experience chosen from the most important citizens.
Thus it continued right on to the time when the Tarquins,
the Etruscan kings, were driven out; and after they
were driven out the Senators chose, each year, two of
their own number to be the rulers of the state for that
year.  As these rulers, called consuls, ruled for a year
only, it is probable that the Senate knew pretty well
what they were likely to do during that year.  The
Senate would not elect consuls who would go against
the will of the Senate.  So probably it was the Senate
that really had the power.
</p>

<p>
The Senate was thus an aristocratic body, as we
might call it.  The men who composed it were called
"patricians"; and there again you see the idea of
reverence for the father's authority, because
"patrician" comes from "pater," meaning a father.
</p>

<p>
But, as we have noticed already, the plebs, or
common people, that is to say, all who were not
patricians, began to assert themselves more and more
against the government by this patrician, or aristocratic,
class.  After a while they gained the right of
holding their own assembly, called the Comitia (from
"co" or "com," meaning together, and "ire" to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P180"></a>180}</span>
go)&mdash;they "went together" in this assembly.  And
as they were, of course, far more in number than the
Senate, they succeeded by degrees in getting more and
more power of law-making and so on into their hands.
They, according to the laws which they succeeded in
passing, became the chief power in the state, and the
Senate was only a bad second to them.
</p>

<p>
But though that was the condition of things according
to the law, the power which the Senate retained
was, in fact, very considerable, because the Senate, still
only a few hundred in number, were always there, in
Rome, ready to be called together and come to a
decision.  The Comitia, composed of members many of
whom lived at a distance outside Rome, and not at
hand to express their views and give their votes, could
not decide matters nearly so quickly; and often, when
Rome was so constantly at war, important decisions
had to be taken quickly.
</p>

<p>
Chiefly for this reason, though in part for various
other reasons too, the power of the Senate was still
great, and far greater than it would have been if they
had kept strictly to what they were allowed to do by
law.
</p>

<p>
The Forum, that famous place of assembly, of which
we may still see the remains in Rome, was the site
where the Comitia met.  It was only those who were
owners of land, or who owned property of a certain
value, who had the right to vote in the Comitia, and it
was a right that belonged only to citizens of the Roman
Republic and a few cities outside, which had won this
privilege by some special services rendered to the
Republic.  In its beginnings the Comitia may have
been open to patricians only, but by the time that
Rome came to take any big part in the story of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P181"></a>181}</span>
world the Comitia had become the assembly of the
people, as opposed to the patrician Senate.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Legions
</span>
</p>

<p>
The ownership of land or of property sufficient to
give a man a vote for the Comitia made him a citizen
in another sense also, namely, that he was obliged, if
summoned, to take arms for the Republic and serve in
war, and these citizens, thus summoned, became the
famous Roman legions which won battles all over the
world.  After a while, as the power of Rome extended,
legions were formed in subject provinces far away
from the capital city, but they were always under the
command of Roman officers.
</p>

<p>
It would take far too long to tell you about all the
stages by which the people, the common citizens, grew
to have more and more power, and the patricians
to have less.  You must understand that the Senate
was not in the least like our House of Lords.  The
eldest son of a Senator did not become a Senator when
his father died, but the numbers of the Senate were
kept up by elections, and some of the highest officials
of the Comitia became Senators by reason of their
holding these offices, so that by degrees many of the
plebs, that is, of the people themselves, became Senators,
and this made the citizens more content than they
would otherwise have been with the Senate deciding
how the wars should be carried on and when it was
right to make war and peace with their enemies.
</p>

<p>
The number of soldiers in a legion was from four
to six thousand.  These legionaries, as they were
called, all being&mdash;at first, at all events&mdash;holders of
property in the Roman Republic, must have felt that
it was for themselves and for their own property that
they went to fight.  That must have added to their
courage and determination.  They were heavily-armed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P182"></a>182}</span>
infantry soldiers, and to each legion was assigned some
auxiliary lighter-armed troops and some cavalry.
</p>

<p>
The way of fighting was much the same as that of
the Macedonian phalanx, and it was actually the
Macedonian phalanx that the Roman legions came
clashing up against when Rome began to extend herself
eastward beyond Italy.
</p>

<p>
That came about in this way.  Philip V., king of
Macedon, had allied himself with the Carthaginians in
the Second Punic War, that war in which Hannibal
seemed to have Rome at his mercy.  During its
progress the Romans had made alliances with several
powers in the East: with Egypt, where one of the
Ptolemies was king; with Rhodes, the large island
lying just off the coast of Asia Minor, which had a
strong navy; with Pergamus, a city state on the mainland,
which also had a strong fleet; and of course she
was the defender, in Italy and in Sicily, of the Greek
colonies there.
</p>

<p>
When she was threatened by Philip of Macedon on
her north-eastern side, she put herself at the head of a
confederation of Greek states against Philip.
</p>

<p>
Philip, on his part, had made an ally of Antiochus,
one of the dynasty of Seleucus, who was king of Syria,
and they agreed between them to take possession of
Egypt, which had little power of its own at this time to
withstand them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Rome against Macedon
</span>
</p>

<p>
Thus the Romans, with all the trouble with Carthage
on their hands on the one side, had these enemies in
Macedonia and right away to Asia Minor on the other.
But the alliance with Pergamus and Rhodes gave them
strength in the eastern waters of the Mediterranean.
</p>

<p>
Then, in 201 B.C., the Punic War ended, in a manner
probably quite different from that which Philip and his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P183"></a>183}</span>
Syrian friend had expected.  Rome was free to turn
her full attention to the East.
</p>

<p>
The legions met the Macedonians in several battles
in Greece itself; a force sent from Rhodes defeated an
army that Philip had sent into Asia Minor, where his
ally Antiochus, who had troubles in his own kingdom,
seems to have given him very little help.  Another of
his armies was broken up by the Greeks themselves at
Corinth.  In fact he suffered disaster in all directions.
Within two years the war was over.  The power of
Macedon was crushed.  Philip was allowed, by the
treaty of peace which followed, to keep his kingdom of
Macedonia, but he lost all that he had claimed to hold
in Asia Minor, and Greece was set free from the
sovereignty of the Macedonians which had weighed
over them ever since the conquests of Alexander.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the Punic War Rome had claimed,
and had annexed as her own by right of conquest, both
Sicily and Spain, from which she had expelled the
Carthaginians, but she did not at first, after the defeat
of Philip, claim any of the territory which he lost in
the war.  She left Greece to enjoy the freedom she had
won for her.  But she had, of course, increased her
reputation and her power towards the east of Italy
enormously.  The Greeks looked on Rome as their
liberator and champion.  About Antiochus they
perhaps would not have troubled themselves, since he
had proved such a feeble ally to Philip, but Antiochus
began to stir up trouble for himself by his own
imprudence and ambition.
</p>

<p>
He had given such feeble help to his ally, Philip,
partly because he was engaged in an attack on Egypt.
Already, nearly twenty years before, he had attempted
to gain possession of the Egyptian provinces Phœnicia
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P184"></a>184}</span>
and Palestine, but had been heavily defeated near
Gaza.
</p>

<p>
Now, just at the time that Philip was being finally
beaten off the field in Greece, Antiochus was
completely successful against Egypt.  The reigning
Ptolemy was a child, the government was in weak
hands, Antiochus had little trouble.  Amongst other
consequences of his victories, one was that Palestine
and Jerusalem passed from the hands of Egypt into
the control of Syria, and it seems that the Jews resented
the manner in which the later Ptolemies had ruled
them, and welcomed the change.  The Egyptian
garrison was driven out.
</p>

<p>
Philip, conquered by the Romans, had lost his hold
of the Greek cities in Asia Minor, and Antiochus seems
to have thought it was the moment to take advantage
of the misfortunes of his ally and seized those cities
for his own.
</p>

<p>
Both the Egyptian enterprise and also this in Asia
Minor were a direct offence to the Romans, seeing
that both Egyptians and Greeks were their allies and
looked to Rome for protection.
</p>

<p>
They did not look in vain.  It is likely that
Antiochus did not realise how great Rome had become.
She was a long way off.  But a few years ago she was
scarcely known.  We may imagine that he had very
little idea of the might of the nation whose allies he had
dared to attack.  Perhaps the Romans themselves did
not realise their own strength or the weakness of the
enemy, for they tried their best to come to terms with
him.
</p>

<p>
It was all to no purpose.  Antiochus actually
ventured into Greece itself with an army; but before
he achieved anything of importance the Romans had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P185"></a>185}</span>
come to the help of the Greeks, and the Syrian
force broke up and melted away after the very first
battle.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Legions in Asia
</span>
</p>

<p>
But the Romans had not finished with them yet.
They had seen, perhaps, that the Syrians were less
formidable than they had thought.  The Syrian navy
was beaten heavily by the combined navies of Rome,
Rhodes, and Pergamus.  The following year, that is,
190 B.C., saw a sight new to our story&mdash;Roman legions
in Asia Minor.  They were under the leadership of one
of the Scipios, who was consul for the year and brother
of that Scipio who had led the Roman legions in
Africa in the last years of the Second Punic War, and
for his victories had been given the surname of Scipio
"Africanus."  Scipio Africanus accompanied his brother,
the consul, with the legions in Asia Minor.  There
West met East, and there was no doubt, after the first
clash of arms, with which the victory must be.  The
Roman legionaries under this Scipio, who assumed the
title of "Asiaticus," as his brother took that of
"Africanus," had a discipline and a battle formation
against which the impetuous attacks of the more lightly
armed Syrians broke and wasted themselves.  Just
so far as the Romans chose to advance must those
others recede before them.  They had all Asia behind
them for their retreat.  Rome at her strongest could
not utterly destroy the power of the East as she had
destroyed the power of Carthage; but she could drive
it back and back at her pleasure, so long and so far as
she chose to put out her power.  The East would come
on again after each driving back, like flies at some great
creature which has whisked them away for a moment,
but they could not really get through the great creature's
hide; certainly they could not get to any vital part,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P186"></a>186}</span>
to any centre of his body where they could do him real
hurt.  Rome had perpetual trouble with these buzzing
swarms in the East all through her days of world-power;
but it was this kind of trouble&mdash;vexatious, and costing
her much money and many lives of her soldiers, but
never threatening her own life or power, as the Gauls
from the north had threatened it once, and were to
threaten it, and worse than threaten it, again.
</p>

<p>
After the first punishment had been given to
Antiochus, Rome did not annex any of his dominions
or form them into a province under a Roman governor.
There is this remarkable difference that we may see
between the Romans and other conquerors whom we
have met in the course of this great story, that the
Romans, before they went on farther, always
consolidated, made solid and firm and almost a part of
themselves, what they won.
</p>

<p>
They acted on the principle <i>divide et impera</i>, that
is, disunite people and then you can rule them.  They
did not interfere much with the customs and laws of the
peoples that they conquered.  They let them manage
their affairs in their own way.  They expected them
perhaps to pay tribute and to furnish soldiers for the
army.  So long as they did this they were not greatly
troubled by their Roman governors.  But&mdash;and this
is the point on which the Romans insisted, and to which
they owed a very great deal of their success&mdash;although
these peoples were allowed to manage their own affairs,
within their own borders, they were not allowed to make
wars or treaties of peace and alliance or anything of that
kind with their neighbours.  On all such questions
they had to refer back to Rome and ask her permission
and advice and help.
</p>

<p>
One sees what the effect of that must have been&mdash;to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P187"></a>187}</span>
make these always look to Rome as their sovereign.
That was one effect.  Another was that they were not
able to combine together and so become strong enough
to be a danger to that sovereign.  And Rome was wise
in her dealings with them.  She punished them heavily
if they did not obey her, but rewarded them, by giving
them rights and privileges, if they were very faithful
in obeying and in helping her.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The prudence of Rome
</span>
</p>

<p>
She was prudent, at this moment, in not attempting
to annex any of the domain of Antiochus, because, if
she had, she would have had this province lying far
away out in the East, and between herself and this
province would have been Greece and Macedonia,
which were supposed to be free countries, though they
doubtless knew that Rome could take them for her own
if she chose.
</p>

<p>
Antiochus, lately the ally of Philip, had attacked
and taken Philip's cities in Asia as soon as he knew
that the Romans had broken Philip's power.  Philip,
in revenge, had helped the Romans when they attacked
Antiochus, but he did not get much reward for it, in
the treaty of peace.  He was dissatisfied and restless;
the Greek cities, as usual, quarrelled among themselves.
Another page of the story was turned when Perseus,
son of Philip, succeeding his father on the throne of
Macedon, made an alliance of Thracians, Syrians,
Greeks, and others, and declared war against Rome.
What followed?  The Greeks were very brave while
the Roman legions were in Italy.  As soon as the
legions marched on Greece the fighting spirit went out
of the Greek cities.  Syria was too far East to help the
West.  Macedon and Thrace met Rome in a big battle
fought at Pydna.  Perseus was utterly beaten.  He
was taken prisoner and brought to Rome.  Macedonia
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P188"></a>188}</span>
was allowed some form of freedom, but she began
intriguing and giving trouble again; Rome could suffer
it no longer, and she made Macedonia into a Roman
province.
</p>

<p>
The story of the Greek states after Pydna was much
the same.  The authority of Rome over them was
really supreme if she cared to exert it, but for a while
she contented herself with the punishment of those
that had helped Perseus.  Again, it was their own
imprudence which compelled Rome to take action.
They formed a confederacy and were ill-advised
enough to go to war with her.  It was a war that gave
Rome no trouble.  The Greek armies made little
resistance, some of the cities had their walls razed to
the ground.  Even yet, Greece was not formally
annexed as a Roman province, but the Roman governor
of Macedonia was given some authority over Greece
also, and the states were forbidden to form any more
alliances with each other.  Rome might do as she
would with them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Rome must be obeyed
</span>
</p>

<p>
This being so, you will see that Rome was now in a
position to advance her power, whenever it pleased
her, into Asia Minor without leaving unconquered
nations between the centre of her power and those
Eastern nations.  But she went slowly, perhaps to make
the more sure.  She reduced the power of those strong
naval states, Rhodes and Pergamus, although they had
lately been her allies.  She acted, in all her dealings,
with a purely selfish regard to her own interests.
Egypt acknowledged her supremacy.  A new king of
Syria was appointed under her direction, and as he was
quite young a Roman guardian was given to guide his
actions.  It was said, and no doubt it was said truly,
by the Greek historian Polybius, whom the Romans
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P189"></a>189}</span>
had taken prisoner to Rome, that in all the world men
knew that there was nothing else to be done, if Rome
gave an order, but to obey it.
</p>

<p>
And now I want you to pause a moment in the story
and see whither it has brought us.  For we have now
come to a condition of the world which had never been
seen before.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{<a id="P190"></a>190}</span></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br><br>
ROME MISTRESS OF THE WORLD
</h3>

<p>
We have never before seen the world in the condition
to which we have brought it now, in the whole course
of the story.
</p>

<p>
At first, you will remember, there were the two
great empires warring, the Nile Valley empire and the
empire of the Euphrates and Tigris.  Then came the
Persian.  He overthrew them both.  But then he
came up against a wall too strong for him to break
down, in the opposition of Greece; and he broke his
own head against that wall.  After him came Alexander,
the Macedonian, going through the world, as it was
then known, like a flash of lightning, getting the
better of everything that stood in his way as if it was of
no account at all.  But like a flash of lightning his
light went out again, and he left the world he had
conquered to be cut up into pieces and quarrelled for
by the generals that he had led to the conquest.
</p>

<p>
Then the scene of action shifted westward along the
inland sea.  Carthage had grown to power at the cost
of Phœnicia, her mother-land, and over against Carthage
had grown together, in a wonderfully short time, this
new Roman power.  Carthage and Rome had fought,
and Rome had utterly prevailed.
</p>

<p>
Then Rome, looking eastward, and troubled by
King Pyrrhus, who had helped the Carthaginians,
came in touch with the Macedonians and the Greeks,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P191"></a>191}</span>
and after a period of trouble got the better of both,
came up against the peoples of Asia Minor, and had
them at her mercy whenever she chose to put out
her strength.  Already Egypt, though independent
nominally, had acknowledged Rome as sovereign.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Pax Romana
</span>
</p>

<p>
So you see whither we have come.  Hitherto it has
always been a struggling world that the story has had
to tell of&mdash;one or the other master holding power a
short while perhaps, but never really having a hold
over the whole world and getting all his opponents
under.  It is quite otherwise now.  Rome is mistress;
and she is not going to let go her hold for a very long
while.  When she does lose hold it will be really
because her grip has lost power owing to her own
maladies, rather than that any other very formidable
foe has come against her.
</p>

<p>
You will understand, of course, what I mean when
I talk of "the whole world" at this point of the story,
and what that Greek historian, Polybius, of whom I
told you in the last chapter, meant by it.  He knew,
no doubt, that there was a great deal of the world, in
the sense of land inhabited by human beings, beyond
the wide lands over which the Roman power really
did extend.  But neither he nor any one else in the
Greek or Roman world of that day thought that these
lands and their inhabitants counted for anything.
They did not matter.  These peoples were called
barbarians.  They were considered rather as we
consider the North American Indians or the negroes.
They were far more formidable to the Romans than
either of these are to us, because the people away to
the east and north-east of Syria, to the north of Asia
Minor and Thrace and of Italy itself, all these had
limitless lands behind them, on the sides farthest
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P192"></a>192}</span>
from the central power of Rome, to retreat into when
she came with any power against them.  For the most
part they were peoples who led a wandering life.  It
was no trouble to them to strike their tents and go
back into the wilds.  But it was terrible trouble for
the legions to follow them very far into those wilds;
and the legions could not easily force them to a decided
battle if they did follow them.
</p>

<p>
Therefore the Romans doubtless knew that however
far they might push out their power in the east and
north there would always be peoples on the edge of the
lands which they could really make their own who
would be apt to give trouble and would require small
campaigns to be waged against them from time to
time.  Probably they made up their minds to that.
But inside that wide barbarian fringe, and with the
Atlantic Ocean on the west and the nearly uninhabited
deserts of Africa on the south&mdash;within the wide expanse
of which these form the boundary, the Roman power was
such that if Rome said a thing had to be done, there
was no man who questioned it.  Done that thing had
to be.  That is what is meant by a phrase that you
have most likely heard, the "Pax Romana," the
Roman peace.  It meant the peace which Rome could,
and did, enforce within these regions under her
power&mdash;a peace that could not be broken because every man
knew that whatever she said was to be done, must be
done.  There was no help for it.
</p>

<p>
Of course the peace was not perfect, it was not
untroubled.  No peace ever is.  But it was peace of a
kind that the world had never known before.  The
whole world&mdash;the whole world that mattered&mdash;was
for the first time under one single authority.  It was
also for the last time; for it is a condition that the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P193"></a>193}</span>
world has never been in again since the break-up of
the Roman power.  So I think I was justified in asking
you to stop a moment in the course of the story in
order to consider the position of affairs to which it has
brought us.  It is interesting, is it not?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mithridates
</span>
</p>

<p>
Now, I do not know that there is any need to trouble
you with all the smaller happenings which led to
Rome's asserting herself more and more strongly in
the East.  Probably she would have done better if she
had established her power more strongly in Syria
rather earlier than she did.  In the end she took it
and turned it into one of her provinces as well as the
other lands that she conquered; but by the time she
did so a certain king called Mithridates, of a certain
kingdom called Pontus, on the Black Sea, to the north
of Syria, had made himself very strong, and gave
the Romans a terrible deal of trouble about the year
88 B.C. and onward.
</p>

<p>
But long before that, and even while she was
claiming to impose her "Pax Romana," the Roman
peace, on all the world, she had very little peace within
her own borders.  It is all an outgrowth of the old
trouble that we saw beginning as far back as the time
when the Romans drove out those Etruscan kings
and formed themselves into a Republic.  All through
their story we have seen the Senate, which was for
the most part the high-born, the rich party, on the one
side, and the Comitia, or assembly of the plebeians, on
the other.  And the last was perpetually struggling
to get power and to take power away from the first.
That struggle still went on until it ended in neither of
them having any power at all.  And that happened
in this way.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P194"></a>194}</span>
</p>

<p>
As Rome grew rich, by the plunder and taxation
of the provinces that she conquered and annexed, an
immense number of slaves were brought into Italy.
They cultivated the land for their masters a great
deal more cheaply than the native small farmers could
cultivate it, and at the same time a great deal of corn
and other things that these farmers used to grow was
brought in from the provinces at a cheap price.  The
small farmers, what we might call peasants, could not
grow corn in Italy as cheaply as this, so the fields fell
out of cultivation and the peasants flocked into the
towns where they could get their share of the cheap
corn.
</p>

<p>
Great discontent grew out of this.  Two brothers,
who were leading men of the people, Tiberius and
Caius Gracchus, got laws passed to give the people a
chance of cultivating their land on better terms, but
the selfishness of the rich party, who were opposed to
them, made these laws of no use.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The power of the generals
</span>
</p>

<p>
The people had succeeded in getting one of their
own class, Marius by name, appointed as general of an
army in Africa, which conquered a restless and powerful
people called the Numidians, who had been giving much
anxiety to the Romans and had defeated the armies
under the general that the Senate had sent out in
command.  When Marius came back, as victor, from
Africa, some of the northern barbarous tribes were
harassing Italy itself.  He took command of the army
against them, and again was completely successful.
Thus he rose to great power, and one of his acts, when
at the height of his power, was to repeal the law
according to which it had always been compulsory on the
people to serve in certain legions, and to allow them to
enlist in what legions they pleased.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P195"></a>195}</span>
</p>

<p>
Do you see what that meant?  It meant that the
people would go and enlist under a popular general,
and, this being so, the general became the authority
to whom they gave their allegiance and to whom they
looked up as their head.  It was no longer to Rome
that the soldiers looked as the great authority.  They
looked to their general.
</p>

<p>
That made a very great difference in the whole
state of affairs.  It meant that the general who was
able to rely on his army became really independent of
the power of either Senate or Comitia.  They might
give him orders, but he had the armed force at his
back and could almost please himself as to whether he
should obey the orders or not.
</p>

<p>
Thus it was that the real power passed altogether
out of the hands of the Senate and Comitia and
fell into that of the commanders of the legions, or
of whichever of the several commanders of legions
might prove the strongest.  The Senate or the Comitia,
sometimes the one and sometimes the other, might
appoint the commanders, but once the commanders
were appointed, the power was with them so long as
they could rely on the support of the soldiers.
</p>

<p>
The Senate succeeded in getting leaders devoted
to their interests appointed to command some of the
legions, and the Comitia got men of their own side
appointed to others, and so it came to pass that there
were these two opposing forces in the world, the legions
that were under a general who was on the side of the
aristocratic party and the legions that were commanded
by one who favoured the popular side.
</p>

<p>
It is much more easy to see, long after it all happened,
how one state of affairs grows out of what has gone
before, than it is for the people who are acting in them
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P196"></a>196}</span>
to see it.  We can see how it all happened much better
than they can have seen then, but I suppose that even
those Romans who were in the very middle of it all and
were actors in the story must have realised that
something was going on which they had never known before,
and which was certain to make a great difference, when
they saw one of these commanders of the legions march
his forces right up to
Rome and take forcible
possession of the city.

ROMAN LEGIONARIES.
</p>

<p>
This commander was
Sulla, and he acted as
he did because Rome at
the time had fallen into
such a state of lawlessness,
owing to the fights
between the rich people
and the poor, and to all
the evil causes that I have
mentioned, that no man's
property or life was safe.
Sulla came in with
his soldiers and enforced
what we might call
Martial Law.  He restored
order, but he restored it only by terribly severe
punishments.  He was on the side of the Senate, of
the rich and patrician class.  This was in the year 88 B.C.
But he did not stay in Rome.  That war on the
eastern boundary of the Empire with King Mithridates
of Pontus required attention.  Mithridates had been
terribly successful at its commencement.  He had
overrun Asia Minor, and it is said that in a single day
80,000 persons who claimed to be Romans, or to be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P197"></a>197}</span>
under the protection of the great Roman power, were
massacred.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Sulla and Pompey
</span>
</p>

<p>
Sulla was a great general.  Mithridates had
advanced into Greece, but he made no stand against
the legions.  His armies were defeated in Asia Minor
too, and by 84 B.C. this, which was called the First
Mithridatic War, was over.  A treaty was made
whereby the territories of the king of Pontus were
strictly defined, and Sulla came back to Rome.
</p>

<p>
The popular party had been busy while he was
away.  Marius, their champion, was dead, but his
place had been taken by another popular general,
Cinna.  When Sulla returned he found Rome in
possession of Cinna and the populace.  With his own
legions Sulla overthrew Cinna and his power, and his
punishment of his opponents was even more fearfully
cruel than before.  The story of the years that followed
is a terrible one.  The life of no man of any importance
was safe in Rome if he was suspected of showing any
favour to the popular cause.
</p>

<p>
And now another very great name comes into the
story, that of Pompey&mdash;Pompey the Great as he was
sometimes called.  In Rome, Sulla had drowned in
blood the opposition of the popular party; but there
were legions outside Italy itself, and some of them, in
Spain, were under popular leadership.  Against these
Pompey went out as commander on the patrician side.
After some three years of fighting he was completely
successful.  Sulla, wearied of power and tyranny, had
thrown up his dictatorship at Rome and had retired
into the country and to private life.  Pompey led
back his victorious legions, and with his soldiers at the
gates of the city demanded the honours which he
thought due to him as victor.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P198"></a>198}</span>
</p>

<p>
There was no denying them to him, and he was
elected Consul.
</p>

<p>
The condition of affairs in Italy was bad.  There
had been a great uprising of the slaves who had become
very numerous and had banded themselves together,
to a number said to be 70,000.  They traversed the
country, pillaging and acting in defiance of all law.
</p>

<p>
Pompey, as Consul and with the military power at
his command, showed himself a far less cruel dictator
than Sulla.  He revoked many of the worst laws and
lawless institutions of Sulla.  The slave revolt, as it
was called, was put down.  Something like order was
restored again.  And when all this had been done in
Italy, Pompey was given, or maybe took for himself,
command of a fleet and of armies in the East, for the
special purpose of destroying the sea pirates in the
eastern part of the Mediterranean and strengthening the
Roman power in Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor.  The
treaty with Mithridates had not succeeded in making
peace in that corner of the world for long, and, though
he had been beaten in one or two battles by the legions,
he was still in the field and far beyond the boundaries
which that treaty had assigned to him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Julius Cæsar
</span>
</p>

<p>
Pompey carried all before him.  He put down the
pirates in a series of sea fights, settled affairs in Syria,
which he at length made into a Roman province, and
then went northward, where he met Mithridates and
defeated him so decisively that he gave the Romans
no further trouble, and shortly afterwards took his
own life.  With all these victories to his credit, Pompey
returned to Italy, where by that time had come into
the story one whose name, great as was that of Pompey,
was to become greater even than his&mdash;Julius Cæsar.
</p>

<p>
Cæsar had gained fame both as an orator and as a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P199"></a>199}</span>
soldier.  His sympathies were with the popular party.
He had been chosen as Consul, but had not yet entered
into that office when Pompey came back, triumphant,
from the East.  We might expect that Pompey, who
was on the patrician side, would be opposed to Cæsar,
but Pompey was dissatisfied with his treatment by his
own party.  He seems to have promised his soldiers,
as a reward for their bravery and their victories, that
they should be given grants of land, to live on, in Italy.
The Senate were not ready to confirm this promise, and
they did not approve of all that he had done in Asia
Minor.
</p>

<p>
The result was that Cæsar and Pompey became
friends and allies.  Cæsar married Pompey's daughter.
They brought into their alliance one Crassus, whose
chief value to them as a friend was that he had immense
wealth.  This combination was known as the
Triumvirate, or combination of three men (from <i>tres</i>,
meaning three, and <i>vir</i>, meaning man).  Acting
together, the three could get any laws passed that they
pleased.  One of the measures which they joined in
passing made an immense difference in our story.  It
was that measure which gave to Cæsar the command of
the legions in Gaul.
</p>

<p>
The difference that it was to make was not seen just
at first.  Cæsar went up north to his command.  His
campaign against the Gauls, of which he himself has
written the account in his "Commentaries," are a
little out of the direct line of our great story.  They
had their effect on the big story, for if they had ended
in any other way than the way in which they did, if
Cæsar had been killed or conquered&mdash;and he was
nearly killed or conquered more than once&mdash;the big
story might have gone quite differently.  But as it was,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P200"></a>200}</span>
in the end&mdash;and the end of his campaigns in Gaul did
not come until nine years had passed&mdash;he was
completely victorious.  During those years he made an
expedition to Great Britain, but did not stay there
long.  At the end of the nine years he came back.  He
was chosen as Consul for the second time.  He came
back to the borders of Italy at the head of his victorious
legions.  He was commanded by the Senate to disband
his troops before coming to Rome to be made Consul.
The Senate and Pompey, for Pompey still was chief
man in Rome, did not want a general with soldiers
devoted to him at the gates of the city.
</p>

<p>
Cæsar halted for a time, while messages about this
went to and fro between him and the Senate, the Senate
ordering him to disband the troops, and Cæsar refusing.
He halted on the banks of a small stream, the Rubicon,
which has become very famous because it was the
boundary of Italy beyond which he was forbidden to go
at the head of troops.
</p>

<p>
Finally, in the year 49 B.C., he determined to go
against the order of the Senate and brave the
consequences.  <i>Cæsar crossed the Rubicon!</i>
</p>

<p>
The crossing of that river meant war.  Cæsar knew
it.  The Senate knew it.  Pompey knew it.  The
great Pompey fled before him, and took command of
the Senatorial armies in Greece.  Cæsar, who had no
fleet, went in pursuit.
</p>

<p>
They met at Pharsalia, in Thessaly, and there was
fought one of the great battles of history.  Cæsar
gained the day, and Pompey again fled, into Egypt.
Again Cæsar pursued him, and was met on coming to
Egypt by a messenger who thought to find favour with
him by bringing him the head of Pompey, who had
been murdered.  But Cæsar was a generous enemy.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P201"></a>201}</span>
Pompey had been his friend, and he mourned his death
with respect.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Cleopatra
</span>
</p>

<p>
There was trouble in Egypt at this time.  The
rulers were supposed to be one of the Ptolemies and
Cleopatra, also of the same family, the two sharing the
throne.  But the Ptolemy had thrust the queen out
and claimed to rule alone.  Cæsar, captivated by the
beauty of Cleopatra, restored her to her share in the
government.  Then he marched up with his force into
Syria.  There, too, there was trouble.
</p>

<p>
The trouble was with a powerful people called the
Parthians, coming from that part of Asia, east of the
Euphrates, from which the Persians had come long ago.
They were a warlike nation, fighting on horseback,
lightly clad in mail; and their mode of fighting was like
that of the Persians of old&mdash;to come galloping down
upon the enemy, to shower arrows, discharged from
horseback, upon him, to gallop off again, turning in
the saddle and shooting as they went, and then to
reform, to come back again, and repeat the same
tactics until the enemy's formation was broken up.
</p>

<p>
Really it was very like the fighting of the Persians,
which, as we saw, was broken by the solid Greek
phalanx.  But these Parthians prevailed in several
battles against the Roman legions.  They had defeated
a Roman army under the command of that Crassus
who was one of the triumvirate.  Of these three,
Cæsar was the only one who was alive after Pompey's
murder in Egypt.
</p>

<p>
Cæsar met the Parthian forces and defeated them
very heavily.  He drove them back over the Euphrates;
and the Euphrates we have to look on as the boundary,
eastward, of the Roman power.  The Romans did
not try to press farther.  They had enough, and more
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P202"></a>202}</span>
than enough, work on their hands in making good the
conquests they had gained.
</p>

<p>
Cæsar returned to Rome, victorious; but still he
had enemies, in the shape of armies in the field, under
commanders appointed by the Senate.  There were
some such forces in Africa.  Thither Cæsar went and
made an end of them.  Still there were others in Spain,
and there, at length, he seems to have put out the
last spark of opposition by a victory in the battle of
Munda in 45 B.C.  He had crossed the Rubicon in
49 B.C.  What he had accomplished in those four years
is wonderful.  Victorious in Greece, Egypt, Syria,
Africa, Spain.  All enemies had gone down before
him.  He was elected "dictator for life" of the Roman
Commonwealth.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
TROUBLES IN THE EAST
</h3>

<p>
We have seen that in the year 190 B.C. a new thing
happened in Asia Minor&mdash;Roman legions appeared
there for the first time in history.  It was an appearance
which was a sign of what was sure to come, that Rome,
when it pleased her to do so, would conquer all that
country.  Conquer it all, and subdue it to her own
power, in course of time she did.  The last people that
she succeeded in perfectly subduing were the Jews.
</p>

<p>
Judæa, at the date of the arrival in Asia of the
legions, was held as a province of the kingdom of
Syria by one of the dynasty of Seleucus.
</p>

<p>
Seleucus and his Court were, practically, Grecian.
Antioch, the capital of Syria (several of the Seleucid
kings were called Antiochus), was practically a Greek
city.  The influence of Greek thought began to flow
into Judæa and Jerusalem more and more from Syria
and the north, and we have seen already how it flowed
in from Egypt and Alexandria.  It brought in strange
knowledge, strange speculations and, so far as the
Greeks troubled themselves about religion, a strange
religion.  We have seen from of old how intensely the
Jews were devoted to their own religion, and how they
retained it in exile and in persecution.  A very large
number of them held to it fiercely now against all these
new ideas that the Greeks were bringing in.
</p>

<p>
So, all through the hundred years that follow, the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P204"></a>204}</span>
story of the Jews is the story of a series of struggles for
the mastery in Jerusalem between the party that
favoured the Greek new ways and the party faithful
to the old Jewish ways.  The latter came to be called
Pharisees and the former are represented by the
Sadducees, as you read of them in the Bible.
</p>

<p>
Besides this cause of unrest, there was still
constantly trouble between Syria and Egypt.  The fact
that both were overshadowed equally by the growing
power of Rome did not prevent them quarrelling about
their own claims in Palestine.  And Judæa, as ever of
old, lay between the two rivals.  Judæa knew little
peace in these days of the so-called <i>Pax Romana</i>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Fortitude of the Jews
</span>
</p>

<p>
The insults which the national religion and laws
suffered from the "Gentiles," as the Jews called the
Greeks and all who were not of their own race and
way of thinking, roused their great resentment.  The
fighting between the parties was fierce.  There was one
moment in the story when the Jews under those great
fighters, the Maccabees, became really the strongest
power, so long as Rome did not care to exert her power,
in all that region&mdash;stronger than Syria, of which she
had lately been a mere province.  She had power as
extensive as Solomon had wielded when king of Israel
and Judah united.  But it did not endure.  The rivalry
between the two parties within Judæa itself weakened
her.  At the date of Pompey's coming to Syria, about
a hundred years later than the first coming of the
legions, Judæa was again in subjection to Syria, and
Syria herself was made into a Roman province.  Judæa,
like the rest of the world, turned her eyes to Rome as
mistress of them all; but, of them all, the eyes of
Judæa expressed, probably, the least obedience and
submission, the strongest purpose of resistance.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P205"></a>205}</span>
</p>

<p>
It is this strength of resistance that has made the
Jews, in spite of all the calamities that they have
continually had to endure all through the course of
our story, still play such an active and large part in it.
All read with reverence the same sacred Book.  Even
those Jews that had been scattered, and had settled far
from Jerusalem, looked up to Jerusalem as their
capital city.  The Temple of their great God was there.
They received and obeyed orders from there.  They
went up there to great feasts and religious ceremonies.
There were very many Jews in the many Greek cities
of Asia Minor, very many in Egypt, many in Cyprus
and other islands, many in Greece itself.  Although
Judæa was a small subject state when Pompey saw it,
and had an official appointed by Rome as its ruler, it
was important to him to have the favour of the Jews
on his side, just because they were so far and widely
dispersed and could exercise influence in so many
lands.
</p>

<p>
At first, in the struggle between Cæsar and Pompey,
the favour of the Jews had been given to Pompey.
Probably they were disposed to fight for the side that
they thought most likely to win, so as to get some
future favours for themselves in return.  As a matter
of fact, both Greeks and Romans were so little concerned
with religious things that, except for insulting
the Jewish customs by their indifference, they showed
very little hostility to them.
</p>

<p>
When Cæsar went to Egypt he gave the Jews every
opportunity of worshipping God in their own way and
living their peculiar life in the manner that pleased
them.  The official appointed by Rome to govern
Judæa at this time was Antipater, a native of the
neighbouring land of Idumæa, and his son, who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P206"></a>206}</span>
succeeded him in the governorship, was called Herod,
Herod the Great, who ruled, with the title of king
(though he was only a king by leave of Rome, and king
of a country paying tribute to Rome), until the year
4 B.C.  We are just coming now to the Christian Era,
as we call it.  The years will then no longer grow fewer
and fewer as they come to the year of the birth of
Christ; but more and more as they mount up away
from that date.
</p>

<p>
In the early days of the rule of Herod in Judæa,
that is, about the year 40 B.C., there came a new danger
on the land.  Those Parthians, whom Julius Cæsar
had defeated, swarmed back again, on their horses,
across the Euphrates, and swept over a great part of
the country.  Herod implored the help of Rome, and
not in vain; but Julius Cæsar was no longer the world's
master then.  He had been dead for several years.
</p>

<p>
You must, I am sure, remember that scene in the
Senate-house in Rome&mdash;if you do not remember
reading it in any history book you will have heard of
it from Shakespeare's play of Julius Cæsar&mdash;how his
best friends clustered round him, and the dearest of all
gave him a fatal dagger-stroke.  "<i>Et tu, Brute!</i>" he
exclaimed, as even Brutus, his most intimate friend,
dealt a death blow.
</p>

<p>
The assassins of Cæsar asserted that they did the
foul deed for the good of the State, to rid Rome of the
tyranny of the dictator.  That may have been the real
reason of some of them.  Others may have been
thinking of their own advantage and how they might
advance if they put such a big man as Cæsar out of the
way.  But whatever their intentions were, the effect
on the State was terrible.
</p>

<p>
The great orator, Cicero, had hopes that the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P207"></a>207}</span>
Republic might be restored, that the rule of one man
might be ended and the good old days come back again.
But the people in Rome were not such as they had been
in those good old days when they followed the good old
customs.  It is no wonder that they had changed.
</p>

<p>
See what had happened.  Rome had conquered the
world.  Masses of wealth from the conquered provinces
had been brought to her and were constantly coming
in.  The rich men had their splendid houses and villas.
They vied with each other in giving feasts and entertainments
to the populace, in order to gain the votes of the
people and to be elected to high positions, at home or
abroad, in which they could make large fortunes by
receiving bribes or by taxing the provinces.  All their
old ideas of what it was right to do had been upset by
the Greek thought that prevailed through all the world
that was at all educated.  There was no respect for
the laws, and they had no religion that made any
difference to their conduct.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Octavius and Antony
</span>
</p>

<p>
Therefore, when Cæsar was killed, and his power to
dictate and to make the laws obeyed went, at once
there was terrible lawlessness, several parties in the
city trying to get the power into their hands.  Cæsar
had been appointed dictator for life, but no arrangement
had been made about what should happen at his death.
So it went for the space of two years or so, and out of
all the troubles of these two years we find a state of
things coming about very like that which happened
before, when Pompey and Cæsar were the two most
powerful men&mdash;powerful, because each had legions
willing to obey him.  There was a third at that time,
Crassus, powerful in his wealth.  Two men now again
came to the front, each with military forces at his
back&mdash;Octavius and Antony.  There was a third, of less
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P208"></a>208}</span>
power, Lepidus.  Pompey and Cæsar had been friends
at first, and were joined together to rule the affairs
of Rome.  Afterwards they fell fighting, with the
result that you know&mdash;the complete victory of Cæsar.
Crassus had been killed, fighting in the East; and that
was the end of that which was called the first Triumvirate.
</p>

<p>
Antony, the nephew and the friend of Cæsar, had
designs of succeeding to his power, but almost at the
outset he found Octavius, who was Cæsar's
grand-nephew, opposing him.  Antony had been Consul,
with Cæsar, in 44 B.C.  Now he had command of legions
in the north of Italy, and when he went to take up that
command he found Brutus, Cæsar's assassin, holding
possession of a town called Mutina, which he refused
to give up.  Antony attacked him.  The Senate took
the side of Brutus and sent Octavius up in command of
some of the legions to oppose Antony.  Antony was
defeated before the town that he was besieging, and
fled.
</p>

<p>
He fled, but he still had his army.  He was joined
by Lepidus, who brought with him a strong army from
the south.  Octavius may have thought this combined
force too formidable for him, but whatever his reason
was he made friends with Antony, whom he had lately
been fighting, and with Lepidus, and the Senate seems
to have approved of their combination.  Perhaps they
were so strong that they had no choice, but were obliged
to seem to approve.  And so what is called the second
Triumvirate came into existence.
</p>

<p>
Brutus and Cassius, who were trying to bring back
the old republican ways of Government, still held out;
but they were defeated at the famous battle of Philippi,
and the Triumvirate had all power in the Roman world.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P209"></a>209}</span>
</p>

<p>
They proceeded to map out that world in pieces,
so that each should take his portion.  To Lepidus, as
perhaps the least important, was given Africa; to
Antony went Egypt and the East.  Octavius seems to
have had the best of the bargain from the start, with
the home legions and Italy, Greece and Spain, together
with Gaul that Cæsar had conquered, for his own.
Antony married Octavia, who was sister of Octavius;
so it all looked a very good arrangement.
</p>

<p>
But just as trouble had crept in between the chief
men of the first Triumvirate, so too with this second.
</p>

<p>
Antony was not a very prudent man, and Octavius
was.  Antony had the most troublesome frontier to
defend, for to the east was that country of the Parthians
who had come upon Judæa.  Herod's appeal for help
was heard by the Triumvirate.  It was Antony's
special task to deal with them; and, for the time
being, he dealt with them successfully, though he did
not march against them himself.  But one of his
generals took the field and drove them back over the
Euphrates, whence they had come.
</p>

<p>
That was not by any means the end of these
Parthians, however.  We have seen how they fought&mdash;charging
down on the legions, shooting a flight of arrows,
then off again, and again coming back to perform the
same manœuvres.  Just as they did in each particular
battle of a war, so they did in the war itself, as a whole.
If the war went against them, away they went, over
the Euphrates and as far east as the Romans cared to
pursue.  They must have known that the Romans
would not go on pursuing for ever, farther and farther
from their base.  And the Parthians had all Asia to
retreat into.
</p>

<p>
So they retreated, and left Judæa and Herod in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P210"></a>210}</span>
peace, but a very few years later they were making
trouble again, and this time Antony himself led an
army against them, into Parthia itself, and met with a
disastrous defeat.  And now Octavius, who had been
making his own power very firm in Rome and Italy all
this while, thought the time was come when he might
declare war against Antony&mdash;his brother-in-law, and
until lately his friend.
</p>

<p>
Antony had given him much cause.  You will
remember that Queen Cleopatra whom Cæsar had put
on the Egyptian throne beside Ptolemy.  Cæsar had
fallen in love with her.  Antony fell in love with her
too.  For her sake he divorced and sent back Octavia,
his wife, to her brother, Octavius, at Rome.  He
assumed all the airs of an Eastern despotic ruler, with
Cleopatra as his queen.  A great many of his own
people and friends and servants were disgusted by this.
Probably the support that they had given him was not
given very whole-heartedly.  Certainly Octavius could
easily find an excuse for making war on him, for
Antony's ideas of government were not at all such as
agreed with the Romans' idea of how government
should be conducted by a Roman citizen.
</p>

<p>
The deciding battle between the two was a sea-fight
off Actium.  Cleopatra was there, but even she
does not seem to have fought very bravely for Antony.
She turned out of the fight before it was really decided,
and fled, with her ships, to Egypt.  Her flight probably
did decide the result, and Antony, with such ships as
could escape, went to Egypt after her.  Octavius did
not pursue them at once, but a year later he went to
Egypt, and, rather than face his coming, Antony and
Cleopatra committed suicide.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Octavius victorious
</span>
</p>

<p>
Several years before this, Octavius had dealt with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P211"></a>211}</span>
the other man of the Triumvirate, Lepidus.  Lepidus,
like Antony, seems to have acted just as if he wished
Octavius to have a good excuse for getting rid of him,
or of his power.  He came to Sicily from Africa,
apparently at Octavius' bidding; and when he tried,
or was accused of trying, to gain possession of Sicily
for himself, Octavius replied by defeating his forces,
taking Lepidus himself to Italy, and, with more
magnanimity than conquerors often show, allowing him
to retain his high office of Pontifex Maximus.
</p>

<p>
He could well afford to be generous, for he was now
Master of the World; master as not even his
grand-uncle Cæsar, by whom he had been adopted as a son,
had been world-master.  Cæsar was assassinated in
the very year following his election as dictator.
Octavius put down his last rival, Antony, at Actium in
31 B.C., and his world-mastery endured until his death
in 14 A.D.
</p>

<p>
I have said that Octavius was a very prudent man.
He wished all the old forms of republican government to
go on just as they had before.  And so they did go on,
but Octavius must have known, and everybody else
must have known, that they went on just because he
allowed them to do so, that he could stop them or alter
them at any moment if he pleased, that the government
was in form republican&mdash;government by persons
elected by the people&mdash;but that it really was
government by one man.  And far better it should be so.
The other way had been tried and had failed terribly;
it had resulted in fearful lawlessness.  Now the Pax
Romana, that peace of the world under the controlling
power of Rome, really did begin to be something like a
real fact.  It had been very much of a fiction up to
now.  Of course there were troubles on the frontier.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P212"></a>212}</span>
Those Parthians, who had defeated Antony, had to be
dealt with; and they were dealt with, and that disgrace
to the Roman arms was wiped out.
</p>

<p>
I am not sure that the most troublous spot in all
the Empire of Rome was not that little kingdom of
Judæa (sometimes it was a kingdom, under a petty
king like Herod, but oftener it was under a Roman
governor who had the title of procurator), which never
seems to have been able to rest for long together.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br><br>
THE DISPERSAL OF THE JEWS
</h3>

<p>
It is rather puzzling to find, now and again, in this
greatest of all stories, that several different people are
called by the same name, and also that the same person
is called by different names.  Now, besides this Herod
of whom we have been talking, there were several
others.  There was Herod Antipas, his son, before
whom Christ was sent by Pontius Pilate, and also there
was Herod Agrippa, his grandson, who was king of
Judæa for a while, reigning, with such limited power as
the Romans allowed him, from A.D. 37 to his death
in 44.  But for the most part, during all the early
years of the Christian Era, Judæa was governed by
one or other Roman procurator and was not even in
name a kingdom.
</p>

<p>
Octavius, of whom I have been telling you how he
became master of the world, lived till the year 14
A.D. (Anno Domini, or year of our Lord), that is, fourteen
years from the date sometimes assigned to our Lord's
birth.  And now you may be puzzled, because you may
remember that it is said in the Bible that a decree went
out from Cæsar Augustus, about the time of Christ's
birth, that all the world should be taxed.  Cæsar
Augustus, you see, as Master of the World!  The
explanation is that Cæsar Augustus and Octavius were
one and the same person.  He had been adopted as a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P214"></a>214}</span>
son by his great-uncle Julius Cæsar, and then had taken
the name of Cæsar.  Augustus was not a name, but a
title, given by the Romans, just as one of the Pompeys,
and also one of the Herods, was called Magnus, or
the Great.  Augustus means the August one&mdash;the
Magnificent.
</p>

<p>
I have said that Octavius was a prudent man.  He
showed his prudence in the way that he allowed
Antony, who was imprudent, to do all kinds of foolish
things before he set to work to crush his power.  He
was equally prudent in his dealing with Lepidus, his
other rival.  And after he had made an end of the power
of these two, and was the greatest man in the world, he
showed his prudence in refusing to claim any great
title which might give any enemies at Rome a chance
of saying that he was grasping at power and trying to
rule like a despot, as Antony had done.  No doubt he
remembered what had happened to his great-uncle.
</p>

<p>
So he maintained many of the forms of the
republican government and many of the old titles of
the officials of the government, but it was quite evident
all the time that he had the real power, and it was not
any less real because he did not make a big show of
claiming it.  No doubt the Romans were all the more
ready to leave the real power in his hands on that
account.  When his old rival Lepidus died he took to
himself the high office of Pontifex Maximus which he
had allowed Lepidus to hold during his life.
</p>

<p>
Before his death, having no son of his own at that
time alive, he adopted, as the Roman law permitted,
his step-son Tiberius as his colleague during his life and
as his successor after his death; and the Romans fully
approved of his doing so.  Thus, when he died in A.D. 14,
Tiberius succeeded him as ruler of Rome and of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P215"></a>215}</span>
the world.  He had not extended the limits of the
Roman power, but he had made that power far more
secure both in the West and in the East.  The <i>Pax
Romana</i> had become a far more real peace under him
than it had been before.
</p>

<p>
But there never was any real peace in Judæa for
long together.  The national sentiment, as we should
call it, of the old Jewish party, the Conservatives, who
are called Pharisees in the Bible, was too strong for
them to be at peace for any length of time under
foreign rule.  King Agrippa, of whom we were speaking,
was a personal friend of both Caius Caligula and of
Claudius, the two Roman Emperors who succeeded
Tiberius.  We may speak of them as Emperors
(imperators) by this time, for it was a title which they
took without dispute.  Agrippa made himself very
well liked by the Jews, and it seems to have been to
please them that he had St. James beheaded and
St. Peter cast into prison, as is told in the Bible.  The
Bible, too, in the Acts of the Apostles, tells us of his
death in the year A.D. 44.  He was the last king of the
Jews, and at his death Judæa fell again under the
government of the procurators.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The procurators of Judæa
</span>
</p>

<p>
The procurators all seem to have been oppressive
in their government.  Probably their task was a very
difficult one.  They had to govern a people who all
through the story had shown themselves stronger in
the independence of their spirit and in following their
own ways of life than any other.  The force of Roman
soldiers of the legions and of allied troops that they
had at hand to uphold their authority must have been
very small in comparison with the force that the Jews
and their friends could muster at short notice.  They
must have depended a great deal on the fame of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P216"></a>216}</span>
Roman power, and on the knowledge which the Jews
must have had that if Rome really cared to take serious
measures against them they could have no hope of
success.  Rome's power, if she cared to exert it, would
be overwhelming.
</p>

<p>
But Rome was far away.  Perhaps she would not
take the trouble to exert that power.
</p>

<p>
That is how the Jewish party probably thought
about it all; and the procurators and even the kings
of Judæa had to try to uphold the Roman power as
best they could, and yet to do what they could not to
drive the Jews into the rebellion that they were always
on the point of making, and now and again actually
did make.
</p>

<p>
Pontius Pilate was procurator at the time of Christ's
trial.  You know how he gained the execration of all
the Christian world ever since by sacrificing Christ to
the hate of the Jews.  He had sent Christ to Herod
Antipas, because Herod was ruler of Galilee, not of
Judæa, at the time, and Christ was considered, from
his birthplace, to be a Galilæan.  Pilate no doubt
would have been well pleased if Herod had taken the
responsibility on himself of judging the case, but
Herod sent Christ back to Pilate.  The Christians
were already many enough to be a formidable body,
and the rulers of Judæa had now to deal with three
parties bitterly opposed to each other, the Jews who
held to their old traditions, the Jews who had become
Christians, and the small governing class of Romans
and their friends.

<br>
FROM THE ARCH OF TITUS (SHOWING THE SPOILS OF JERUSALEM <br>
CARRIED IN TRIUMPH).
</p>

<p>
A good deal of what we know of the story comes
from Josephus, the great Jewish historian, and an
enemy of the Romans.  He would be likely to say
hard things of the procurators.  But, even allowing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P217"></a>217}</span>
for that, it does seem as if the later procurators, after
the death of King Herod Agrippa, were very oppressive.
</p>

<p>
It was in the time of Florus, who was procurator
from A.D. 64 to 66, that the trouble which had been
growing came to a head.  The state of things in Jerusalem
and Judæa generally was terrible.  Bands of assassins
called Sicarii, or daggermen (from <i>sica</i>, a dagger),
went about almost unmolested by authority.  They
were supposed to be very zealous for the old faith,
and no doubt it was to escape them that St. Paul was
taken, as we are told in the Bible, secretly and by
night, from Jerusalem to Cæsarea.  He lay in prison
there, awaiting trial, for two years, while the
procurator Felix, who had been a very oppressive governor,
was succeeded by Festus&mdash;"most noble Festus," as
Paul calls him&mdash;a more just and lenient ruler.  Albinus
followed Festus as procurator, from A.D. 62 to 64, and
then came Florus, the most exacting of them all.
</p>

<p>
What finally caused the Jews to rise up in fury
against the Roman power was that Florus stripped
the Temple, which was just completed in its building,
of some of its sacred treasures.  At first the rebellion
met with a surprising success.  Florus had called in
the aid of the governor of Syria, with a force of 20,000
regular troops and 13,000 auxiliaries, but this was
defeated and broken up by the Jews in a battle at
Beth-horon.  Probably the fate of Jerusalem was
hastened by this victory, for its effect was that Rome
took so serious a view of the revolt that she sent her
ablest general, Vespasian, with ample forces to subdue
it.  The result was certain; yet again the Jews
showed their extraordinary toughness in resisting so
long as they did.  The other cities soon fell to the
Roman arms, but Jerusalem itself held out for three
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P218"></a>218}</span>
years after the beginning of Vespasian's campaign.
It fell in the year A.D. 70, and the fate that had befallen
Carthage was now suffered by Jerusalem.  The newly
built Temple was destroyed&mdash;"not one stone left
upon another," as had been foretold; the walls of the
city were thrown down; the houses were burnt to the
ground; most of the inhabitants were killed, and the
rest taken away into slavery or otherwise dispersed
over the earth.  Jerusalem ceased to exist.  The
Jewish nation no longer had a capital city or a home.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br><br>
HOW THE THREADS DRAW TOGETHER
</h3>

<p>
That is the point to which we have now brought the
story, and that is the point at which I mean to leave
it.  It is a point at which most of the threads of the
story come together.  It might almost seem to us,
looking back over it, as if it were the point to which it
had been designed, by some great designer, that the
story of man should work itself out.
</p>

<p>
You see what the state of the world is.
</p>

<p>
There is this great and wonderful machine of world
government, the Roman power, in full operation.  The
power could reach to any part of the wide empire;
the legions would march along those Roman roads,
made, as you probably know, with a wonderful straightness,
up hill and down dale, never turning aside from
the direction at which they aimed unless it were for a
very steep mountain.  They went, as the Romans
themselves went, direct to their ends, straight, with
no faltering.
</p>

<p>
Posts, or stations for communication, were established
along those roads, after the manner of a relay race.  A
messenger would come galloping along from Rome to
the first post out, and there he would hand his message,
his letter, to another man who would go galloping with
it to the next post along the road, which led perhaps to
the north of Gaul, perhaps to the east of Thrace, perhaps
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P220"></a>220}</span>
to the west of Spain, direct to the provincial governor
or the commander of the legions to whom the letter
was addressed; and so on, stage by stage, till it came
to its destination.
</p>

<p>
It is wonderful, is it not?  Have you not wondered,
when you read of St. Paul's trial, at its being said,
"This man might have been set at liberty if he had not
appealed to Cæsar"?
</p>

<p>
It is wonderful, surely, that all that distance away,
in Palestine, a man, a Jew, just because he was a Roman
citizen (probably Paul's parents had acquired the right
of citizenship by buying it&mdash;as could legally be done)
could appeal from the decision of his judges there and
claim to be taken all the way to Rome.  And this at a
time when he could only go by horseback overland or
by sail oversea!
</p>

<p>
You know how St. Paul did go in a ship from
Alexandria.  That would have been a corn ship; for
Rome was getting most of her corn from Egypt at this
time.  And you know what adventures and calamities
he had by the way.  He was acquitted finally, on that
charge, but he had spent two years in prison at Cæsarea,
and two more in Rome.  And after this acquittal, he
was re-arrested, re-tried and executed&mdash;a terrible
story!
</p>

<p>
But for the moment the point I want you to see is
how far and how certainly Rome could reach out her
arm and do justice, or what was called justice.  It was
a very wonderful machine.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Influence of Greece
</span>
</p>

<p>
So there was this machine, which had all the material
power and was wonderful for purposes of government&mdash;for
organisation, as we say.  But, then, look at the
world, the cities, the civilisations in which it was
operating.  Their thought, their art, their literature,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P221"></a>221}</span>
was not Roman; it was Greek.  Of all the Eastern
part of the world, of Greece itself and all to the east of
Greece, right away to the Euphrates and south of Egypt,
we may say that it had learned to think in the Greek
way before it had ever heard of the Romans at all.
Indeed, we may talk, if we please, of Roman art, Roman
literature and so on; but if we do we have to remember
all the time that there is very little in it that was
original.  It was nearly all copied from the Greek.
The Romans had great men.  They had their great
orator, Cicero; but he was less great than his Greek
predecessor, Demosthenes.  They had Livy and
Tacitus, the historians.  Tacitus had a style of his own.
Perhaps he is the most original writer in prose that
Rome produced.  But Livy compares more with
Thucydides, and the comparison is hardly to the
advantage of the Roman historian.  Besides, we may
ask, "How would Livy have written if he had not had
Thucydides and other Greeks to be his guides?"
</p>

<p>
We may ask, but we can have no certain answer.
The answer that we are obliged to make is that it is
scarcely to be believed that these Romans would have
done as well, or nearly as well, as they did, if the Greeks
had not set them such a good example.
</p>

<p>
Then we may look at the poets.  The <i>Æneid</i> of
Virgil is certainly modelled on the <i>Iliad</i> of Homer, and,
fine though it is, it is far less admirable than the work
of the far older Greek poet.  Horace stands more by
himself, but he uses metres which we know that he
borrowed from the Greek, and it is quite possible that
he stands rather alone because Greek originals on
which he may have modelled his own verse have been
lost.
</p>

<p>
Of writers for the theatre, there is no Roman to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P222"></a>222}</span>
put "in the same street," as we say, with Æschylus,
Sophocles, or Aristophanes.  In science and philosophy
none to compare with Aristotle and Plato.
</p>

<p>
And in the arts, all the finest sculpture and architecture
in Rome is known to have been copied from the
Greeks.  Where are the Roman names to put with
those of Phidias and Praxiteles?
</p>

<p>
Everywhere, throughout the world, if a great
literary work or a great artistic work was done, it
was done either by a Greek or by some one of
another race who had learnt from the Greeks.  If
Rome had conquered and possessed the world by her
arms, Greece had conquered and possessed it by her
thought.  Already, before the Roman conquest of the
world, she had achieved this conquest to the east of
Italy.  By means of the Roman machinery of government,
and those straight roads of the Romans, Greek
thought was distributed all through the Western world
too.
</p>

<p>
So get that picture clear in your minds, of the
Roman Empire as a means of sending out the Greek
culture everywhere.
</p>

<p>
There is something else that you have to see coming
in on top of the Greek thought, distributed along with
that thought, through all the world.  That something
else is Christianity.
</p>

<p>
You have seen this&mdash;if you will remember&mdash;that
in the course of our story we found that the Greeks,
the Greeks at the time when the Persian conquerors
from the east came up against them and could make
their way no farther west, were the first people whom
we met in the whole course of the story to whom
religion did not mean a great deal in their lives.  To
the ancient Egyptians it had meant very much.  To the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P223"></a>223}</span>
ancient Babylonians it was the same.  The Persians
came with the wonderful religion of Zoroaster, or
Zarathustra, which influenced their lives enormously.
The Greeks were the first of the peoples to whom
religion meant very little.  There were a few ceremonies,
annually performed, and so on; but nothing that
affected their character.
</p>

<p>
With the Romans it was the same.  The early
Roman had reverence for the "mos majorum"&mdash;the
custom of their fathers.  They had high ideas of
justice and of such virtues as courage and of their
duties as citizens.  But no religion affected their lives
or their thoughts.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Influence of the Jews
</span>
</p>

<p>
Now, you saw how the Jews from time to time were
dispersed&mdash;to Egypt, to Babylonia, to various parts of
Asia Minor, to the islands and to the Greek cities.  The
Greeks, not caring deeply for religious things, although
greatly interested in philosophy and speculations
about the mysteries of life, allowed the Jews to follow
their own religion and customs wherever they settled.
And the Jews adhered to their own religion and customs
very strictly and tenaciously.  They did not lose them
in the countries in which they were dispersed.  But
they did not bring the people among whom they
settled to their own way of thinking.  They did not
try to do so.  Their idea of their religion was that it
was for them only, for the Jews, for "the seed of
Abraham"&mdash;that is, the descendants of Abraham.
</p>

<p>
When Christianity came, founded on the Jewish
religion, this was all altered.  Yet it was not altered
just at first.  You will remember that it was said that
the Gospel, the good message, of Christianity was "for
the Jew first, and also for the Gentile."  By "Gentile"
was meant any man or woman who was not a Jew.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P224"></a>224}</span>
But you will also remember that this idea, the idea that
Christianity&mdash;the religion which branched out from the
old Jewish religion&mdash;could be for any others than the
Jews came as quite a new idea&mdash;almost as a shock, as
we might say.  You will remember perhaps how St. Peter
dreamed that dream about the meats that were
"common or unclean," as he considered them.  In
his dream he declined to eat those meats.  Then he
was rebuked for calling these things, which had been
divinely created, common and unclean.
</p>

<p>
When he awoke, he accepted that dream as a
warning to him that he was not to look on the Gentile
as a man so "common and defiled" in comparison
with the Jew as not to be able to receive the message
of Christianity.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Message to the Gentiles
</span>
</p>

<p>
But in order to spread Christianity from its source
and around Jerusalem, it was not necessary in the first
instance to go actually to the Gentiles.  You have
seen how the Jews were dispersed throughout the
cities of the world.  The gospel could be carried to
these first, to these Jews of the various dispersals
which had taken place in course of their terribly
troubled story.  They were everywhere, all over the
known world; and to these the Christian message
could, and did, go; and many of them received it and
became Christians.  From them, no doubt, as well as
from St. Paul, "the apostle to the Gentiles," and
other special messengers and missionaries, Christianity
spread to those among whom these dispersed and
exiled Jews were living, but it was only gradually that
the idea grew that it was a world religion, and not for
the Jews only.
</p>

<p>
To one other point I would draw your attention.
Most of Christ's followers were very humble men, of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P225"></a>225}</span>
little or no education.  They heard the words and
carried His message among their own people.  But
the cities of the world, as we have seen, were inhabited
by men whose minds were filled with Greek thought,
Greek philosophy.  They had no religion that made a
real difference in their lives, although they speculated
eagerly about "the unknown god," and paid reverence
to such deities as "Diana of the Ephesians"; but they
were highly educated.
</p>

<p>
If these fishermen of the Sea of Galilee, who were
Christ's first disciples, these humble men of whom I
wrote just now, had gone about from city to city and
spoken of Christ and of Christianity in the very simple
language in which they must have spoken of these
things, what effect could they have had on the people
whose minds were full of philosophical speculations?
Very little.  To accept the gospel of Christ "like a little
child" would have been quite impossible for these men
whose minds were formed by the Greek thought.
</p>

<p>
But after those first humble fishermen and the like
came others, men of learning: St. Luke, who was a
doctor, a medical man, a scientific man; St. John and
St. Paul.  All these, and many more, no doubt, who
became fervent Christians, had been educated in the
Greek philosophy.  The writings of St. John and of
St. Paul show beyond possibility of mistake that this
philosophy was familiar to them and that their minds
and thoughts worked in the ways that it had taught
them.
</p>

<p>
Directly they began to feel the reality of Christ's
message, and that He really was a divine Person, then
they, naturally, were able to see in His message and
teaching a great deal that the fishermen had not
understood.  They saw that it was a message which could be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P226"></a>226}</span>
interpreted in such a way as to fit in with all that
philosophical speculation with which the minds of all
educated men in the world were full.  It not only
fitted in with that speculation, but it seemed to come
as the crown and the completion of it all.  It gave it
just what it had been very badly wanting.  It brought
God into a world that had been seeking, seeking very
hard, to find God, but a world, as we have seen, that, in
spite of all the seeking, was practically Godless.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The designed end
</span>
</p>

<p>
Now, that is the conclusion of this Greatest Story in
the World, or, at least, it is the point at which it seems
best to me to leave it.  The threads of the story have
come together now.  They have come together in
this sense, that we have the great machine formed by
the Roman government ready to convey any message
throughout the length and breadth of the world (or of
what was then counted as making up the world).
That is the first thing.  Then we have the Greek
thought distributed all along the world roads which
this machine had made, and along which it keeps up
the communications.  And finally we have the Jews,
that people of such extraordinary toughness, so
marvellously determined to hold on to their own ways
of life and of serving God, thoroughly dispersed all the
world over, and so carrying their religion and their
religious books, which are the base of the Christian
religion, with them everywhere.
</p>

<p>
These are the three great facts which have come
together at this point at which we are leaving this
great story&mdash;the Roman world-power, the Greek
world-thought, the Christian world-religion.  That
the last had to go through dreadful trials and suffer
terrible persecution before it could become world-wide
(even as the world was understood then) makes no
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P227"></a>227}</span>
difference.  The foundations had been laid on which
it was to be built.
</p>

<p>
I do not know how it may seem to you, but to me it
rather looks as if the whole story, all through the ages,
even from the first page where we began to trace it,
say some five thousand years before Christ, had been
working up to just this point&mdash;as if it all had been
designed to this end.
</p>

<p>
Understand me&mdash;I do not say that it is so.  None
of us is able to tell how far man has been allowed to act
of his own free will in forming his story on the earth,
and in what chapters and pages of the story his acts
have been determined by a Higher Power.  We know
that he is allowed much freedom.  We are sure, too,
that the freedom is not unlimited.  Therefore it is
impossible for us to tell, of any particular action or
series of actions, whether they are all man's own or
whether they have been arranged for him.  I will
only say this, that it looks to me very much as if it
had been arranged that the Roman power, the Greek
thought, and the Christian religion should come
together just at this moment in our story and complete
each other for the service of man.  I say that it looks
to me as if it were so.  Do each of you think it out for
yourself and see how it appears to you.
